Though  in the screen of ICE overarching, if we expand each candidate, overarched syllabuses are shown at candidate level but with different overarched-count for different session.

",update the table for HRP1728 by running the script.,"If a Named entry is created by the user, Infotype 1728 would be updated with the sub types CS01 and CS03.
When any Reserve candidates in CECP are amended as a Named entry, then the field “HS_STATE” in Infotype 1728 would be changed from A (active) to I (Inactive) of sub type 9001.
SoR Printing Program (ZEXPR_CERTIFICATE_PRINT) considers the field “HS_STATE” of Infotype 1728 to print SoR ,provided “HS_STATE” is in “I” -Inactive status of sub type 9001 and the statuses of other two subtypes CS01 & CS03 should be active (Job for reference: Z_DA_E_LIVE_CERTIFICATE_PRINT).
",Software Issue,"
Fix deployed in the DEC MTR , RFC 18703
As part of PR#2910 solution, Errors for “Start date is after end date” and “Billing document is already cancelled” have been addressed and deployed into production environment
Technical analysis :For “Start date is after end date
BPM RFC Z_BAPI_CHANGE_REG_BOOKING triggers the above error. Standard function module HRIQ_HS_STATUS_SAVE which is called within BPM RFC ends with start date is after end date error.
The standard function module is checking for validity date which considers the system date as start date and academic calendar date as end date. Calendar date is calculated by standard function module HRIQ_ACAD_SESSION_DATES_GET. Observed that calendar end date is picked as last date of the week (week which holds the assessment date).
If any student detail changes take place after the above maintained Academic Calendar, system will get the results in above said error. 
Technical analysis :
Changes done in RFC Z_EXP_RFC_UPD_ENTRYORDER in routine process_entry_data and added a condition to check whether the billing document has already been considered for cancellation by previous entry line item, if so skips cancellation for current line item execution.

Expectation is that a single ZI case should get created per candidate and for relevant composite module. The duplication is occurring rarely and is not replicable.
",Software Issue,"To prevent the creation of duplicate Result Enquiry cases for the same candidate, a check has to be invoked at RFC: Z_POS_CASE_CREATION  level, to identify whether there is already ZI case created for the same candidate. If one such ZI case is already being created before, for the same candidate, then creation of one more ZI case for the same candidate shall not be allowed.

System will try to retrieve already created ZI case for the current candidate BP, from Quality notification header table and Quality Notification Items table. If valid ZI case exists for the current candidate BP then a flag shall be set. Before calling the RFC: Z_POS_CASE_CREATION, the value of the flag needs to be checked, If it set as ‘X’, then system will bypass the call to the RFC. Thus creation of duplicate Result Enquiry cases can be prevented.

The changes needs to be done at line number: 205 within RFC: Z_POS_CASE_CREATION

Moreover, system will prompt the user with a pop up ‘Results Enquiry - Clerical Check (Stage 1) case is already being created for the candidate’, if the user is trying to create duplicate case ‘ZI’ for the same candidate BP from different sessions or multiple users are working on the same candidate.

We can able to replicate the issue in our local as well as SUP environments. As stated earlier also, it was intermittent and the frequency of replication was very low after several tries. Most of the replication falls under one category mentioned below  ""When two different examiners at the same time selects the same marking session to retrieve items to mark""    Please find one such incident where we have replicated the problem. See attachment 'Incident# 448762.png'.  After investigation, we can find that both the examiners were trying to fetch next item for marking and have initiated the request(by clicking on the same marking session link) at the same point of time. As a result two calls were generated and they were processed at similar instances which resulted in inserting two identical records in the back-end database.    As per our investigation, thread locking mechanism(for preventing parallel processing of requests) implemented in the code is not functioning properly.",,Code changes identified and provided to Metrica team further action under MET-6963,Software Issue,"Code fix applied as part of v17.4 on 05/09/2017, RFC 17799.",Request for Change

It appears that the records have been removed from ISP since the ODS deployment on 7th March, although this has not been 100% confirmed. However, CIE are confident that the records were available on 22nd February, and were missing by 14th March. We suspect that changes to the way IsDeletedFromSource flags are applied have gone wrong in this table.    176 components that were marked on-screen in the November 2016 session cannot be found in vQPSessAC, and 8 components from the live March 2017 session. A list is attached.    As an example, we have undertaken some investigation into component 9389/11 in November 2016:  Assessmentcode=9389  ComponentID=11  SessionID=10530  SessionAssessmentComponentID=1478628    This SessionAssessmentComponentID does not exist in table vQPSessAC. However, it does exist in table QuestionPaperItemGroups and is linked with QuestionPaperID=6019912.    QuestionPaperID=6019912 exists in vQPSessAC, associated with SessionAssessmentComponentID=1422966. But this SessionAssessmentComponentID does not exist in table SessionAssessmentComponents. It is presumably an old version of the assessment and is deleted from source (SessionAssessmentComponents.IsDeletedFromSource=1).    So it looks like there is a problem with records being marked as deleted in vQPSessAC – an old record persists in the table and the live record is no longer available. We know that the record linking the live SessionAssessmentComponentID to the live QuestionPaperID existed until a few weeks ago, as reporting was working correctly. Exactly the same SAS queries now return no records for component 9389/11.",,"It is long standing issue in ODS which should be fixed in subsequent release. Nick asked to get a PR for the issue and after which the incident was closed. This needs to be analysed and set for subsequest release. Priority to be discussed with business users.

Problem Analysis and Resolution #
Assumption: All of my investigation is conducted from the ODS side. So, whatever view is used in the DB ISPwarehouse, for that, I am using the table name from ODS_WH DB, as ODS_WH is the warehouse where all data are loaded finally. In the problem Description it have been said that records are missing from ISPWarehouse table vQPSessAC table, which is actually a view from ODS perspective. This is the view upon table [Session].[QuestionPaperSessionAssessmentComponents] which is in DB ODS_WH.
Throughout this document I have used the table [Session].[QuestionPaperSessionAssessmentComponents] where the records are missing.
Analysis: The source from where the data is loaded in the table [Session].[QuestionPaperSessionAssessmentComponents] is another transformation table “[etl].[Session_QuestionPaperSessionAssessmentComponents]” which is in staging database. I have checked in this table whether any entries for the SessionAssessmentComponentID 1478628 is available or not. But found it is not available.
 
So, I suspect that something is wrong in loading the etl table. So, I investigated to know how the table [etl].[Session_QuestionPaperSessionAssessmentComponents] is populated. I found that it is populated by CIE data from staging table and being looked up with the table “[etl].[Session_QuestionPaperSessionAssessmentComponents].
Below is the screenshot for the output of Lookup table and the staging table :
 
The above action is done through SSIS package. We can see for both of the output, AssessmentCode, SessionID, ComponentID, BusinessstreamID, ComponentVersionNumber are all same. The only difference is in the value for AssessmentVersionNumber, which is 3 for the SessionAssessmentComponent = 1478626, which matches with the actual data coming from the staging table. See value for ASV_VER_NO. But in the lookup this AssessmentVersionNumber field has not been used to join both tables. That’s why the SSIS is returning the first row with the SessionAssessmentComponentID 1422966, which is technically wrong because as stated it is presumably an old version of the assessment and is deleted from source.

1. When Panels are apportioned in EPS for Moderators, for some reason they do not seem to update back in Repository. Maybe due to timing or data issues as there is no audit to track the cause behind this.
2. With increasing mismatches of data, EPS and Repository was going out of sync.

I have been trying to use OCR interchange to compare our results to national figures, but have some questions:    1. I have attached two Excel spreadsheets which I downloaded from your site. Unit analysis shows our average UMS and national UMS for all modules we sat last year. C1 Analysis 2014-2016 shows the results for the C1 Maths module (4721). The data on these is different - on the first it states that the national average UMS is 68; on the second it states 71 - how can this be?  2. I would like to compare our results to Similar Centres; firstly can I check what this means (we are a state funded sixth college; does that define our Similar Centres). Secondly; how can I do this - I can't seem to check the corresponding box on the Filter.

Priority group used for holding page not reverting when primary server recovers,Disable holding page server in the priority group for DFD.,"Issue is due to slow ramp time pool setting being enable along side priority group activation, In most production environments, the rate at which connections are received is sufficient for the Slow Ramp Time setting to act as a timer. However, in environments with a low connection rate, a pool configured to use priority groups could experience unexpected behavior. For example, a lower priority pool member may remain in the active priority group longer than the Slow Ramp Time setting indicates,.

The Slow Ramp Time feature (enabled by default) is used to slowly increase the number of connection requests that are load balanced to a new pool member. The Slow Ramp Time setting controls the percentage of connections that are sent to a new pool member by specifying the duration, in seconds, that a pool member is in slow ramp mode. For example, if the Slow Ramp Time setting is set to 10 seconds (the default setting), when a newly enabled pool member has been available for one second, the system begins load balancing 1/10 of the connections that would have been sent to the new pool member had the Slow Ramp Time setting been disabled. Each second thereafter, the system increases the amount of traffic load balanced to the new pool member. So, after the pool member has been available for nine seconds, the system is load balancing 90 percent of the normal load to that pool member. When the pool member has been available for longer than the Slow Ramp Time value, the pool member receives its full proportion of the incoming traffic.

When TMM is updating the slow ramp status for a pool member, if the slow ramp time has elapsed, TMM clears the slow ramp flag. Depending on the rate at which connections are received, a new pool member's slow ramp flag may remain set longer than the duration of the Slow Ramp Time setting specifies because TMM checks the slow ramp flag status only while processing connection requests.",Software Issue,Disable Slow Ramp Time on DFD under RFC 17512.,Request for Change

We have used the same UCI number (0701649460) when submitting a modified material request (Uncontracted Braille) for one candidate across two separate KADs (30.11.2017 and 02.12.2017) for centre ES024.

For planet edu especially for BEC products we observed that recently included additional of service material i.e. PE Logistic Serv (print / dispatch). Due to this existed MO creation program considering service material as additional quantity and quantities are getting doubled and updating at MO.  

Details :

1. In foreground mode of MO creation program, the filtration happens based on the selection screen which is “Program of Study” in the input screen and only that material will be considered.
2. The service material line item will be other than the input and will not be considered. Please find the example from QA1 –
3. This issue happens only when the material order creation is done via background mode.
4. As we referred earlier, for planet edu quantities are getting doubled specially for BEC products consist of service materials.
5. The quantity is getting doubled because there is no filter or logic in the code to omit the service material line item

Also, while reverting, it could be noticed that the scores in Writing Task 2 component were ified.

This job runs every 30min between 8:15 AM to 7:45 PM BST and 6:00 AM to 21:30 PM BST respectively for O side and M side EPS.

Root Cause Analysis:
This happens when the jobs are executing the following statement in package STSAUTOMATION:
45:     execute immediate 'ALTER TABLE STSPACKET NOLOGGING';
257:   execute immediate 'ALTER TABLE STSPACKET LOGGING';

Investigative analysis: 
Is there a real need to set the table to NOLOGGING (which requires a lock on the table)? This risks any recovery especially if the timeout occurs when trying to set the table back into LOGGING mode as it might continue in a NOLOGGING state. 

The main concern was that if anything happens to the DB, you’ll only recover the data affected from the last hot backup (which are created every 10 min), not from the backup archive logs.

As STS receive data from MEPS, OEPS and SAP end, the volume of the data is too high and with respect to the current implementation, three benefits listed below as the said jobs are executed in each 15 min in STSPRD01:
1. Space is saved in the redo log files (UAT DB was down due to high volume of redo log generation).
2. The time for insert/update statement execution is decreased as each job needs to complete within 15 min.
3. Performance improves for parallel creation of large tables (i.e. STSITEM, STSSCRIPT etc.).
Mail chain regarding primary investigating of this issue attached (RE  Incident# 476913.msg).",Need to unlock STSPACKET table to execute next scheduled jobs.,"Root Cause Analysis:
This happens when the jobs are executing the following statement in package STSAUTOMATION:
45:     execute immediate 'ALTER TABLE STSPACKET NOLOGGING';
257:   execute immediate 'ALTER TABLE STSPACKET LOGGING';

Investigative analysis: 
Is there a real need to set the table to NOLOGGING (which requires a lock on the table)? This risks any recovery especially if the timeout occurs when trying to set the table back into LOGGING mode as it might continue in a NOLOGGING state. 

The main concern was that if anything happens to the DB, you’ll only recover the data affected from the last hot backup (which are created every 10 min), not from the backup archive logs.

As STS receive data from MEPS, OEPS and SAP end, the volume of the data is too high and with respect to the current implementation, three benefits listed below as the said jobs are executed in each 15 min in STSPRD01:
1. Space is saved in the redo log files (UAT DB was down due to high volume of redo log generation).
2. The time for insert/update statement execution is decreased as each job needs to complete within 15 min.
3. Performance improves for parallel creation of large tables (i.e. STSITEM, STSSCRIPT etc.).

At the moment this procedure gets the session, assessment, component, centre details from centre_sess_comp_entries table, and the candidate details from the candidates table.  For the candidate details it will look for a value in the column tt_external_uid, if a value exists it will use this for the UCI number, if a value does not exist, it will look for a value in the unique_identifier column and then use this value for the UCI number.

Currently the tt_external_uid and the unique_identifier columns on OPRD are the same, so only one value can be sent in the CEE feed to RM.  The same does not apply to MPRD.  UK centres submit their own unique ID, which is the value in the tt_external_uid column and this can be the same as they have submitted for an OCR entry, and it is this which is causing the current duplicate UCI issue.

Even though we send the session, assessment, component details in the CEE feed, RM do not use this information for indexing scripts, they only use the UCI number that we send in the feed.

Donna Durose recommends that we change the EPS stored procedure esmqry.GETCEE so that if it is fetching candidate details for CIE to always use the unique_identifier column.

In the design there is a procedure for packaging of results on the basis of measures received for each candidate ""RESDET"".""ucles.rd.procs.common::PACKAGING"" and to set status_code as ‘NOT_TRANSFERRED’ as highlighted in screenshot below:The logic applied is to prevent packaging of results for any candidate_uid to become ready to transfer if there is one or more candidate_measure_uid is present with status_code = ‘NOT_TRANSFERRED’ in ""RESDET"".""ucles.rd.data::RESULT_TRANSFER"" table i.e. to prevent packaging and creation of second set of results for a candidate respectively.

Below is the proposed join conditions :
In tt_package_ready_set, we are receiving candidate_uid from previous steps of procedure and checking if the measuredef set is really complete and the counts are equal. Taking these candidate_uids, we joinned candidate_entry and candidate_measure table to see if any corresponding candidate_measure_uid is present in ""RESDET"".""ucles.rd.data::RESULT_TRANSFER"" table with status_code ='NOT_TRANSFERRED’ and exclude the candidate_uid for further processing using NOT EXISTS.

The process is whenever candidates are created/ changed, the 2am BODS job will push all the candidates details to legacy portal PRDB/ESOLCR.

1.       Monitoring the job as  a part of daily check. If the job is failed, get the candidate details and sent to ESOLCR Manually.
2.       Additionally at the assessment date, get all the candidate BP associated with the entry orders, check and reconfirm that all have reached to Legacy portal.

During dry run testing it became apparent that SNMP traps were not working when sent to the shared virtual ip address which Prime uses when in an HA pair, 10.112.41.10. Investigation showed that the HA had actually broken between the primary (10.112.43.150) and secondary (10.112.43.151) servers possibly a good while ago. The primary server appeared to be in a bad state as none of the services were started and would not start after several attempts and restarts. Whilst the services were not started, it seemed as though the primary still considered itself active and both servers were contending for the shared virtual ip address, which is usually only bound to one node.

On Tuesday evening whilst attempting to restore functionality to the primary server, the HA configuration between the two servers got removed which left the secondary server which had been active and working inaccessible.

Yesterday a VM backup of both servers was restored and functionality of the secondary server came back however, this was only after increasing the memory of the server as initially it was reporting lack of memory which was killing crucial system processes. The secondary server remains accessible today, but there may still be issues with memory usage and database problems.

There is currently no resilience to Prime, as the primary server is still not able to start its services. The secondary server although working, may have memory leak issues which may potentially be bug related.

I will log a TAC case with Cisco and explain the situation and provide them with output from both servers. Hopefully they can help us with a plan to restore full functionality to both nodes with minimal disruption.",Cisco is currently working,Database corruption,Software Issue,Rebuild of Prime to version 3.2.

Hence, if a deployment happens to a non-PRD environment, then there is a SCALESET UP event (a new VM is created to react to a load increase) that new VM will attempt to use the non-PRD parameter files, meaning the password for the SSL certificate will fail (or the wrong SSL certificate is being used, depending on your point of view) and the VM will fail to build.",We've currently paused all dpeloys to non-prd environments whilst working on a fix.,Bug in the deployment process.,Software Issue,Re-write deployment scripts to be different between environments.,Process Change

The issue that user has experienced is described below.

Issue description:
---------------------------------
There is a problem each content production user is facing while they add the Discrimination or Facility or Difficulty attributes in the test level inside the test details page. Please see the error screen shot attached 511647_error.png. 

The error occurs only when the above mentioned fields are having more than one numeric value added to it. Please see the attached image 511647.png red highlighted part as an example.

Issue can be replicated in two ways as mentioned below:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item already on test
1. Log in. Choose a role that has access to Tests.
2. Go to Tests.
3. Open any test that contains an item with multiple numeric values for a single attribute. In our current setup, these are ""Discrimination"" or ""Facility"" values on multiple-interaction items.
4. Open the column picker on the left-hand (test construction) side of the window.
5. Turn on the ""Discrimination"" or ""Facility"" column. Click OK.
6. This triggers a server runtime error.
 
Place item onto test
1. Log in. Choose a role that has access to Tests.
2. Go to Tests.
3. Create a new test.
4. Open the column picker on the left-hand (test construction) side of the window.
5. Turn on the ""Discrimination"" or ""Facility"" column. Click OK.
6. Add an item with multiple numeric values for a single attribute to the test.
7. This triggers a server runtime error.
 
Once in the state that generates the error, any further attempts to open a test page (with an offending item) will trigger the same error.

For now we have added an error handling code as described in the workaround part.","We have added an error handling code so that the user does not experience an error while navigate to the test details page.

Please find the attached database snapshot (image001.png) which would depict the above scenario. This process (Results not updated even after individual component marking) however is not replicable from the application end and may point to transactional issues while committing the values to the database after the component marking had been completed.

Major Incident Manager: Brian Simpson

Description of fault : We had a query last week from Centre 17610 (#619009) who encountered an error importing results into SIMS (their MIS package) for their students for 0654CX (Co-ordinated Science iGCSE).
The error is: 'Result not in range defined for the Aspect'.

These results are the RUK files that we produce and send via AVCO, for Centres' use in A2C.

We've had a call from Customer Services this morning who have now fielded three calls regarding the same thing, all for 0654. It seems as though this should be a double award however only one grade is appearing in the Centres' files so they will not upload. As far as I can tell, 0654 has a double grade for every candidate in the files we have produced.
This appears to only be effecting the RUK files. The result PDFs show the correct double grade.

Please see the screenshot attached from Centre 14378.

The Centres who have got in touch are:
14378
17610
61925
29140

Please investigate this as a matter of urgency as we have sent out incomplete results to centres.

The User Login Report also shows that the user did not log into the website on that date.

Causal analysis:

While looking into this, we found that the application audits the results in such a way that it looks like the user has confirmed scores in SECOND_ENTRY for candidates belonging to the reported test session.

Please find the attached mail communication where the issue is further explained with the example of one such reported user and the timestamp on which he has given the scores for one of the candidates for that test session.

Business Impact: 

Administration and the user are unable to understand how the scoring was being done when the user was physically not present at the centre.",,"When second entry scores are submitted, the component's state is changed from SECOND_ENTRY to SECOND_ENTRY_PENDING (in the back end). The component will remain in a ""pending"" state until IWAS can transition it to either ""RESULTS_COMPLETE"" or ""JAGGED_ENTRY"". At this point, IWAS does not record the time of this change in the component state tables (eg. result_listening_state) where part of the result history export data comes from. Once IWAS is allowed to transition the component to another state, that's when the component state for second entry is created. However, by the time this happens, IWAS has already lost the modification date information for the second entry. ",Software Issue,"This could be solved by reworking some parts of results engine and would require some more regression testing on the results entry page.

IWAS also records all modification dates in the component audit tables (eg. result_listening_audit) but these tables aren't built for generating reports and will cause performance issues if this is used to generate reports.

However, it could be confirmed from backend that successful instances are found along with the problematic ones as mentioned above since 25-JUL-17 till date.

Causal Analysis: 
While investigating it further, we have noticed a specific type of technical exception (i.e. NullPointerException) while trying to either generate the URL or authorizing recipients for the report to whom the mail would be sent.

Replication Steps:
The issue cannot be replicated as we do not have email sent functionality at local and also it needs integration to other dependent systems like BizTalk and SSRS reporting server.

Please find the attached document which contains both technical and non-technical details of our investigation.

Business Impact: 
Sometimes the recipients (Centre User L1) of these emails do not find any attachment of Candidate EOR letter.",,"comment from Jon Phillips:
""ReportRegistry.java has a member variable:
private Map<ReportController, ReportDescriptor> reports;
But ReportRegistry is a Spring stateless bean and should not keep state with member variables.
I believe that when Spring re-creates ReportRegistry the reports map is not re-initialised and this causes null-pointer we see thrown in the error logs.
A simple refactor exercise to remove reports as a member variable will fix this issue. Alternatively a check could be done to verify that reports has contents but this a poorer solution.

My proposed diagnosis above also explains why we see this issue in PRD but we don't see it in UAT.
Spring only removes and replaces beans (ReportRegistry) when the application is under load and this does not happen in UAT.""",Software Issue,Removed reports as a member variable ,Request for Change

For some EARs there were data issues and hence it failed to load in the temporary tables with in EPS. For these the respective data was first corrected in Interchange ( omit unnecessary spaces etc) and then re-pushed into EPS to resolve it.
","EAR created in Interchange feeds through in following process:
1. EAR is created in Interchange and be ready to pushed.
2. SSIS job picks those EARs and update a flag in Interchange and writes the file in EPS ftp
3. Then, those file was validated and loaded in temp-table - tt_req_interchange_requests_in, via SQL-LOADER.
4. During loading through SQL loader, it validates the data and creates a log. In case any bad-data found, a file with bad data is created. Also, records in original file after that bad record is not loaded in EPS temp-table y SQL loader in that run. This is designed as per SQL-loader’s control file.
5. Once the EAR is loaded in tem-table, after that, the EAR is processed from the temp-table to main table resut_enquiries by a shell script – o-usreq006.sh
6. Then EPS EAR information is again pushed back to Interchange through OWB job.
                This problem of EAR not feeding can be categorized in three type problem/reason as follows :
1. In EAR file there is a bad data with long name with unnecessary space values. Due to this this, data is not loaded through SQL-loader, as mentioned at Step-4. Also, as mentioned in the same step, the rest EAR which is following to that bad record are not processed. As a resolution of this, unnecessary space was removed and pushed again from Interchange.
Suggestion: In these cases, can we not put data validations and data cleansing at source/Interchange end. Any invalid data should be prevented from creation at Interchange, in the first place. If however, there is still some invalid data, they should not be pushed to EPS end.
2. The EAR which was not processed was on file processed on some certain dates and loaded in temp-table but still not loaded in EPS main table as follows:
2.1. EAR failed to process due to some data validation. Ex – EAR raised for a component for which no entry exists for regarding records. As a resolution, correct detail should be submitted by centre/OCR.
Suggestion: Again, these should be taken care at source/Interchange end so that invalid data is not sent to EPS.

2.2. The responsible shell fails or was down for some reason and unable to process valid EAR. Therefore, they got stuck in temp-table. As a resolution, either EAR can be re-pushed or that responsible pl/sql packaged procedure - result_enquiries_maint.Capture_Interchange_Requests can be run for that stucked EAR file.
  Notes: In Appendix, please find a sample EAR file, log and bad file, just for a reference.

CaMLA Metrica -Truncation of comments after double quotes.,"The issue is regarding truncation of text that are entered after double quotes.
The issue is occurring in metrica admin -> any item -> comment button-> add comment.
Here when we add a comment with double quotes and save it, the text after the double quotes are getting truncated. 
We investigated the issue and we could see that a java function named addnewcomment() is being called when a new comment is added.

File-  MetricaAdmin\modules\content\controls\ formeditor.aspx
Function – addNewComment


My change :-

Before the code was – 
insertHtmlAfterSelection(""<span class='comment' id='"" + guid + ""' user='<%= Page.User.Identity.Name %>' date='"" + now.format(""dd/MM/yy h:mm tt"") + ""' text=\"""" + commentText + ""\"" stamp='"" + commentStamp + ""' version='"" + currentVersion + ""'></span>"");

I found that the escape character, shown in green were causing the truncation 

After change the code is -

insertHtmlAfterSelection(""<span class='comment' id='"" + guid + ""' user='<%= Page.User.Identity.Name %>' date='"" + now.format(""dd/MM/yy h:mm tt"") + ""' text='"" + commentText + ""' stamp='"" + commentStamp + ""' version='"" + currentVersion + ""'></span>"");

The single quotes were used and the truncation problem was no more occurring.

But then we found out that after getting the text from Rad editor, the single quotes are being converted to single quotes. 
The same issue is occurring for editing an existing comment which calls another java function (in the same file) named saveEditedComment(), where we have not made any changes.

This means that the issue of double quotes being converted to single quotes is not occurring due to my change, but it occurs from before.

We could find that the issues were occurring  due the pipe symbols (""|"") that were added to the values for ""facility"" and ""discrimination"", in case of multiple interactions.

8th Sept 2017: # 517786 raised,  server in the BODS cluster was having issues in connecting to databases to which jobs were failing. 
Workaround: The BODS team moved scheduled jobs to run on dedicated server instead of continuing on the failing cluster.
Issue with failed cluster ODBC connection was resolved, server was restored to the BODS cluster along with returning BODS server schedules to use all 4 clusters the next day.
In between moving this server, the support team had deactivated the scheduled job between next run without impacting the job’s schedule. 
When server was restored back into the BODS cluster, the Job schedules reactivated picking up the activation(system/server time) instead of the original scheduled time.  
This resulted in #520406 being raised: Data not pushing through from SAP via BODS to EPS
BODS team changed the BODS schedule back to original start time for this schedule, removing the incorrect older schedule entries from BODS server to restore normal processing activity. 
BTS support teams processed the backlog of EAR PoS data to be pushed from BODS to EPS to resolve the incident.
Root Cause is attributed to the reactivation of the BODS scheduled jobs moved from dedicated server to Cluster server, the job scheduler picked up the activation time (system/server time) as start time rather than the earlier original scheduled start time. 
",,"There was two issues here;
1) The initial root cause of this PR was the ODBCINI environment variable was configured incorrectly on upsapap153 application server which was causing intermittent ODBC connection issues. 
2) The 2nd issue was the BODS job schedule getting messed up due to the BODS team trying to implement a workaround by moving the jobs on to a separate app server and then moving it back - it caused time scheduling issues.

There is also SQL Recompile issue being reported by Foglight on CWEPRDAG01. This not only slows down the process that is executing the procedure, but adds extra CPU load on the server. The June 2017 Health Check report also mentioned of consistent high CPU utilization on CWEPRDAG01. Additional CPU resource may be required for the 2 servers in the Availability Group.

Index Fragmentation in some large indexes in Tridion_cm is also a potential issue. This may indicate that some process or activity is causing excessive fragmentation on large indexes. This needs further investigation and possibly changing the schedule of the index maintenance job.

On CWEPRDAG02 and CWEPRDAG03, Object lock contention was observed during the monitoring period, taking 72.08% for CWEPRDAG02 and 85% for CWEPRDAG03 of response time. There is also an occasional blocking event on Tridion_Broker.

We are experiencing a repeat of the above incident whereby packets relating to unstructured components for CIE Nov ’17 (2142) are being booked in under the CIE June ’17 session (1979) as they share the same QPRD.

Dear Steve Smith,

The following incident has been logged for you:

Incident ID: 470903

Customer Name: Steve Smith

Status: Logged

Subject: Session 1979 (CIE June 2017) Unstructured components Booking in undersession 1824 (CIE Nov 2016)

Description:
Good Morning



We have come across some instances where packets for an unstructured component from CIE June ‘17 session 1979 are getting Booked In under CIE November ’16 session 1824. We believe this could be due to the QPRD being the same for both sessions.



Please see examples below relating to component 9093/21:



CIE November 2016 (1824)

QPRD = 909321

STS Session ID = 10530



CIE June 2016 (1979)

QPRD = 909321

STS Session ID = 14126



Please see below CIE June packets UA0837655 and 13565938 for 9093/21 that have booked in under session 1824:


















Please could this be looked into?

Once this data has reached the TRF backend, scheduled calls from the Partner sites(such as IDP or BCUK) requests the CRT webservice to pull the candidate data falling within the START DATE and END DATE. This is then picked up by the CRT job and transferred in batches. For some instances we are being reported of missing candidate records for some centres and test centres by the partners. ","1. If the currently running batch is being affected by the error, then the present batch data (from ieltsresultstransferbatch table) is to be edited to limit each transfer processing to 9,000 records. This is the safety threshold but ideally given the present implementation, the job can process upto 10,000 records in 30 mins.

2. If the reported candidates belong to a historical session whose data is no longer present in the ieltsresultstransferbatch table, then the historical candidates whose LAST_MODIFIED is falling in the same range of  START DATE  and END DATE is to be taken into account and then they are to be processed in controlled batches of 9000 records each.","After analysing the CRT logs(attached), it is evident that after the request arrives from the Partners, the list of candidates are calculated based on the following query:

SELECT  P_TransferID,
TEST_DATE,
C.CENTRE_NUMBER,
CANDIDATE_NUMBER,
-1
FROM    LIFESKILLS_CANDIDATE C
JOIN CENTRE C1
ON C.CENTRE_NUMBER = C1.CENTRE_NUMBER
JOIN IELTSRESULTSTRANSFERDATAACCESS I
ON I.CENTRE_TYPE = TRIM(C1.TYPE_OF_CENTRE)
AND I.USER_ID = P_UserName
WHERE   LAST_MODIFIED >= P_StartDate AND LAST_MODIFIED <= P_EndDate;

Here P_StartDate is the START DATE and P_EndDate is the END DATE.

Thus, all the candidates falling in the above criteria is considered for the present transfer. Lets say this transfer picks up 14,000 records. This transfer is then split into batches of 1000 each, thus 14 batches. These batches are processed one at a time. Normally 10 batches are processed in 30 mins after which the job to delete the expired batches is called:

RdbmsOperation with SQL [IELTS_RESULTS_TRANSFER_WS.DeleteExpiredBatches]

Since the records are deleted from the batch table, they are not found by the below query:

""
Batch Retrieval SQL: SELECT C.CENTRE_NUMBER, C.CANDIDATE_NUMBER, C.TEST_DATE, C.AG_MODUAL, C.TITLE, C.FAMILY_NAME, C.GIVEN_NAME, C.ID_NUMBER, C.DATE_OF_BIRTH, C.OVERALL_RESULT, C.R_ABSENCE, C.L_ABSENCE, C.W_ABSENCE, C.S_ABSENCE, C.R_BAND_SCORE, C.L_BAND_SCORE, C.W_BAND_SCORE, C.S_BAND_SCORE, C.CERTID AS TRF_NUMBER, '' AS TRF_COMMENT, LAST_MODIFIED AS EFFECTIVE_DATE from CANDIDAT C , IELTSRESULTSTRANSFERBATCH I WHERE C.TEST_DATE = I.TEST_DATE AND C.CENTRE_NUMBER = I.CENTRE_NUMBER AND C.CANDIDATE_NUMBER = I.CANDIDATE_NUMBER  AND I.TRANSFER_ID =  <TRANSFER_ID> AND I.BATCH_ID = <BATCH_NUMBER>

Root Cause Analysis:
Upon investigating the reported issue (i.e. technical exception encountered while publishing Life Skill Calendar), we found a particular statement in the code flow (for the test publishing functionality) where the application is trying to retrieve the sitting information based on LIFE_SKILLS exam and unfortunately there were no details for the same due to the current implementation of the aforementioned Intranet Job (i.e. testInstanceCreateJob) and the functionality ends up with technical exception – “java.lang.NullPointerException”.

Business Impact:

Therefore if you try to generate examiner packing note for 23 it will generate for unit 2 ( considering the unit 2 entry is present otherwise no packing note will be generated). Also we have checked that in production the examiner packing note date is null for all unit   entries against unit 23 ,which indicates examiner packing note had not actually generated for unit 23.

Due to this system throws an error.,Manually change the When Occurred field value via F4 option,"User is unable to update tariffs for Special Considerations cases in transaction ZIW58 in using mass update functionality.
User can enter all the required fields but the below error message appears when he tries to save the changes:
Error message issues: Class ID, Subclass ID, When occurred, Percentage are inconsistent.

Technical Analysis:
As per the analysis, from transaction IW52, while updating the case status as ‘APPLY TARRIF’ for ZA case, for new classification ID and sub classification ID, the value of WHEN OCCURRED field is not getting refreshed with the new value. It is holding the old value and correspondingly while saving the case, it is going into error.
The validation for the Classification ID, Sub classification ID, When Occurred, Impact Table Name and Percentage combination is done against the entries in view: ZPOS_V_TTSC. For the new Classification ID , Sub classification ID, the value of When occurred is not getting refreshed internally and hence the validation is failing while the case is being saved.
",Software Issue,"In order to resolve the above issue, following changes need to be done at code level:

Include: SAPLXQQM, for screen: 110, in Process After Input block, system is checking if WHEN OCCURRED field value (from pop up) is blank, it will not update the same in the table control at IW52 screen level. To address this issue it is required to have a logic in the include: ZXQQMI17, that will get the value of WHEN OCCURRED for view: ZPOS_V_TTSC based on new CLASS ID and SUB CLASS ID (entered by the user in the pop up). If the current fetched value of WHEN OCCURRED is blank then also it will update the same and refresh the old value in the table control for the screen 103 at IW52 level. This will prevent the system to throw error even if Class ID, Sub class ID, When Occurred and Percentage value combination is consistent.

The logic needs to be invoked  at line number 114 ZXQQMI17

Bug:

The parameter passed to HANA procedure should be 'v_when_acq_completed' and not 'current_timestamp' (see attached code).
",Manual update in HANA DB,"In this design, there is a ABAP program ZPOS_ECC_TO_CDM_CONV_SCHEDULER which is used for converting ECC data into CDM format.
1. In this program the sequential execution of the HANA procedure for converting the required field into CDM format from ECC and also the procedure to run the calculation process is carried out.
2. The conversion of the CDM format for the individual field has caused no error.
3. In this method RUN_CEN_CAND_MD_CONVERSION we are getting the last successfully completed time and for that we are querying table ‘BATCH_JOB_RUN’, fetching the details of centre_candidate_cdm_conversion. Before making this call, have to take last job run timestamp which is successfully executed.
4. The method calls HANA procedure ""PROC_CDM_CEN_CAND_MD_CONVERSION"" and we are passing the parameter ‘current_timestamp’. 
5. The ‘v_when_acq_completed’ parameter holds the last job run timestamp, this parameter must be used instead of the ‘Current_timestamp’ to the HANA procedure, so that the mismatch of TIMESTAMP can be rectified.
",Software Issue,"After changing the input parameter from CURRENT_TIMESTAMP to V_WHEN_ACQ_COMPLETED while calling the HANA database procedure, ECC and CDM table data (TIMESTAMP) will be in sync which will  prevent any data(TIMESTAMP) inconsistencies between HANA and CDM in future.

A BIG-IP virtual server configured with a Client SSL profile may be vulnerable to an Adaptive Chosen Ciphertext attack (AKA Bleichenbacher attack) against RSA, which when exploited, may result in plaintext recovery of encrypted messages and/or a Man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack, despite the attacker not having gained access to the server’s private key itself.

Details on this issue can be found at: https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K21905460",None,"When encrypting something with RSA, using PKCS#1 v1.5, the data that is to be encrypted is first padded, then the padded value is converted into an integer, and the RSA modular exponentiation (with the public exponent) is applied. Upon decryption, the modular exponentiation (with the private exponent) is applied, and then the padding is removed. The core of Bleichenbacher's attack relies on an oracle: the attack works if there is some system, somewhere, which can tell, given a sequence of bytes of the length of an encrypted message, whether decryption would yield something which has the proper padding format or not.

An example would be a SSL/TLS server. In the initial handshake, at some point, the client is supposed to generate a random key (the ""pre-master secret""), encrypt it with the server's public key, and send it. The server decrypts the value, obtains the pre-master secret, and then compute from that pre-master secret the keys used for symmetric encryption of the rest of the connection. Using the standard for guidance, the client sends a ClientKeyExchange (which contains the encrypted pre-master secret), then a ChangeCipherSpec, then Finished; this last message is encrypted with the derived symmetric key and its contents are verified by the server.

If the client sends a random sequence of bytes of the right length to the server instead of a properly encrypted pre-master secret, then the server will, most of the time, respond with an error message telling ""I tried to decrypt your ClientKeyExchange contents, but this failed, there was not a proper padding in it"". However, by pure chance, it may happen that the random string, after applying the modular exponentiation, yields something which really looks like a pre-master secret with correct padding. In that case, the server will not complain about the ClientKeyExchange, but about the Finished message, which will be incorrectly encrypted.

This is the information the attacker wants: whether the sequence of bytes he sent would, upon decryption, look properly padded or not.",Third Party/External issue,"Upgrade to unaffected firmware version

Each of the above tasks has two versions (version 0 and version 1). For all of the above, the interaction response IDs end in -0-1 in version 0 as well as version 1.



When a task version number increases, it's expected that the interaction response IDs also increase, in-line with the task version number.



OIWAC1043CB is an example of a task with 3 versions (0, 1, 2) which is working as expected. The interaction response IDs display with suffixes of 0-1, 1-1 and 2-1.



Are you able to investigate the interaction response ID suffix problem for the above mentioned tasks please? It's also worth nothing that there are likely to be other tasks which are also affected by this problem.

Thank you for the screenshot, I will escalate this to our IT department,



Can you confirm if you get this error when you just enter the website address or do you get a chance to enter your username password details and then this error shows?

Hi there

I received the email below from you today and went onto the CCMS site in order to download the material I need to complete the task. Unfortunately it does not allow me to get on the site.  The message says there is a server error in ""/ofis Application"" and then says

- Description: An error occurred during the compilation of a resource required to service this request. Please review the following specific error details and modify your source code appropriately.

Compiler Error Message: CS1501: No overload for method 'ReBuildTokenAndHandleLoginRequirements' takes 4 arguments



Could you please let me know what I should do.

Many thanks

Sally Powell

Dear Assessor



Thank you for agreeing to complete the Assessment Analyst task for J536/05 June 2018, it is now ready for you to access on CCMS (https://ccms.cambridgeassessment.org.uk/ccms<https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/3-IqC1r11IMZ1pZUp8Giz?domain=ccms.cambridgeassessment.org.uk>)

Please ignore the task deadline in CCMS and instead complete your check by 02/01/18 or sooner.  If there is an issue with the deadline, please contact us as soon as possible.

How to complete the Assessment Analyst task

1.       Download and open the following documents:

*         Question Paper (and any other related material i.e. Insert) - in any pdf reader software

*         Blank Assessment Analyst report form - in MS Word (.docx)

*         Assessment Analyst role descriptor - in any pdf reader software



2.       You must work through every question in the assessment materials, using the question analysis technique.

Please do not provide any answers, instead you are expected to work the question paper:

-       Highlight key words

-       Underline and circle key words

-       Draw lines to link different parts of the question, e.g. information in a table, with the question stem.



3.       Complete the Assessment Analyst form.



4.       Upload the marked material (either a scanned colour copy, if marked up by hand or an annotated PDF) and the completed Assessment Analyst form onto CCMS, and notify us by email.



5.       Delete all materials you have downloaded on your computer (including from the recycle/trash bin folder).



Further instructions on completing this task are provided in the Assessment Tester guide attached.

Under no circumstances should any confidential material be emailed back to the QP Management email account.

The completed Report form and worked material must only be uploaded into CCMS.



Kind regards

As a result, IWAS contains multiple records for STED ROs having same name and ORGANIZATION_ID but different country information.

Analysis: In the reported incident, there was a requirement to change the country information for few STED ROs from TRF Verification Site. Once it was done, the country values were correctly updated for respective ROs in IBASE. To reflect the same in IWAS, a new BASEDATA was released which was having updated country information for those ROs. However, it leads to duplicate entries in IWAS for those ROs with same name and ORGANIZATION_ID but different country information.

Similar issue was previously addressed under ITSM Problem Record# 3956 (currently closed) wherein we had shared an extract detailing all those discrepant ROs. An analysis was also done on the technical complexities existed in that process to bring these three databases (TRF, IBAE & IWAS) in sync. In that analysis, we found few areas where it lacks proper communication.

Here, I am attaching another extract (PFA: RO_discrepancies_18.01.2018.xlsx.xlsx) which contains the details of existing ROs which are currently not in sync between these systems. In each worksheet of this extract, the existence of data highlights areas that are affected in this flow.

5. As per EPS code logic, if manual grade is set for any assessment, it restricts the deletion/removal of that grade information and abort the process.
6. Thus, in this entry file load, EPS aborted the entry validation process due to the manual grade is set for the parent assessment on the fly(though the parent assessment did not have any manual grade prior to the entry validation).

The reason why the issue occurs is the implemented validation which considers the aforementioned characters as invalid.

While trying to create candidate entry singly from application by giving the above invalid character to any of its fields, it could be seen that standard warning messages are shown to the user restricting him to save the details.

However, we found another way of making candidate entry with the same invalid character through candidate XML import functionality. This is the reason why application still has candidates with this invalid character in their details. If any alteration is done to these candidates at later point of time, the application searches for invalid characters and once it gets the same, it nullifies the test session details for the user session and as a result, ‘NullPointerException’ is encountered while fetching the details of the test session.

a. We think that when MM refers to a ‘super test version’, this is equivalent to CA’s bank data. I believe the MM super test version / banks are W1AC, W2 AC, W1 GT, W2 GT, R AC, R GT and L (which is shared between GT and AC)
b. When we send the xml version of the answer keys, MM checks the whole database to see if it has seen the same SQID (response Id) at any time in the past (PB or CB across all banks not just the relevant bank for the type of test being referenced). If it does, then it rejects the new attempt to load the data.
c. The task that was referenced by the error had been previously used in a test before the xml answer key feed was active (i.e. it was supplied in csv (human readable) format).
Observations:
2) We can receive error messages from MM 
a. when we prime TDM feeds to it and
b. when MM starts to do automarking and finds errors.
3) The session sat at AU240 at 9am (local time, 10pm UK time) for listening test was attempted to be marked around 41 minutes later. This resulted in an error message email being generated at 10:43pm stating “AU24017010687,CD-L,Must enrol in a Super Test Version”.
4) Investigations have shown that:
a. The test version used was 18A33L
b. The test material was published to MM on Monday 22/01/2018 between 10am and 11am (sent as CHG records)
c. An error message was returned around 10:45am on Monday stating “Test is not a super test version”
d. The error on Monday and from the instigation of marking on 24th only referenced the third task out of the 4 tasks in the test.
e. On 20/10/2017 a CB listening test was sat (16D09) which used the same task 3 as the 18A33L test. The 16D09 test was primed using csv format data (i.e. human readable) and is still active (within 90 days to cover EORs and other queries).
f. The priming of the answer keys on Monday was using the new xml format feed.

Can the partners help to resolve this conundrum that we can’t prime the task to allow marking to continue for 18A33L without deleting the answer keys for 16D09L which still needs to be available for queries. Can they relax the cross DB checks of the SQIDs to allow us to get the answer keys in for 18A33L and allow marking to continue.
Surely the checking for uniqueness should only occur on the relevant banks (super test versions) that are relevant for the component being sat and not across all possible super test versions since a listening task is never used in reading or writing tests and vice versa?

This is due to ESM logic looking at two different dates to determine which record is to be used for aggregation.

For example, we receive a CLEB from RM on 17th January 2018 which is the Production Date.  We then receive an IMRB from RM on 19th January 2018, which is a Production Date, however it also has a Marking Date which is 8th December 2017.  ESM will look for the latest record for aggregation by looking for a marking date for an IMRB and a production date for a CLEB, therefore in this example it will use the CLEB as the 17th January 2018 is later than the marking date of 8th December 2017 for the IMRB (see attached CLEB_v_IMRB.png).

This will process and load a Missing Mark to EPS.

If this is fixed, it may also fix PR#3234 because the 'previous marker ID' required in a remark request can only be found if a previous mark has been processed rather than the CLEB (missing mark).
","In the past the business has had to manually key the marks into EPS, however now we can delete the CLEB and replay the IMRB so that the mark will be passed to EPS (see attached sample script).",ESM ignores latest IMRB marks in aggregation process when there is a CLEB (missing mark).

The Network services team (James loose and Zane Sheldrake) have now approached me asking for system access to do exactly what this development is meant to achieve. this is why this new PR is being raised.

below is the solution over from the original BFS.

""2.3 Overview of Solution

In current design Oracle database is used as staging database. BPM processes captures all events and record them in Oracle DB however booking changes are not recorded in oracle DB.

As part of this development we are enhancing the existing development to capture the Audit trail information in Oracle database for all updates on booking and entries including the approval and rejection scenarios. 

A report will be created on the Oracle database to show updated on Booking and Entries-Entry order level changes and Candidate Entry level changes. This report will list out all fields at a particular time. It will not highlight changes, business need to compare 2 rows.  The report will be accessed from the portal by admin users.""

the old ITSM incident was 321886

This report would give the business the ability to see full details of all amendments, creations and withdrawals for all entries. it would also provide visibility on bookings.

The backup job in PRD has changed to use a dynamically assigned file name, so the refresh job needs to be reviewed. The job is currently disabled to prevent setting the database to restricted_user mode.

The problem is:

1. The database is in an availability group, therefore you can't always be sure where the backup file will be stored.
2. The name is dynamically generated and so the refresh process can't use a hardcoded name.
3. The only way to get the name of the latest backup is to directly query the PRD server, either at a SQL Server level, or via Powershell and retrieving the flat file path.
4. UTLSUP01A is on the ucles.data domain.

Expectation is that a single ZI case should get created per candidate and for relevant composite module. The duplication is occurring rarely and is not replicable.",Software Issue,"To prevent the creation of duplicate Result Enquiry cases for the same candidate, a check has to be invoked at RFC: Z_POS_CASE_CREATION  level, to identify whether there is already ZI case created for the same candidate. If one such ZI case is already being created before, for the same candidate, then creation of one more ZI case for the same candidate shall not be allowed.

System will try to retrieve already created ZI case for the current candidate BP, from Quality notification header table and Quality Notification Items table. If valid ZI case exists for the current candidate BP then a flag shall be set. Before calling the RFC: Z_POS_CASE_CREATION, the value of the flag needs to be checked, If it set as ‘X’, then system will bypass the call to the RFC. Thus creation of duplicate Result Enquiry cases can be prevented.

The changes needs to be done at line number: 205 within RFC: Z_POS_CASE_CREATION

Moreover, system will prompt the user with a pop up ‘Results Enquiry - Clerical Check (Stage 1) case is already being created for the candidate’, if the user is trying to create duplicate case ‘ZI’ for the same candidate BP from different sessions or multiple users are working on the same candidate.

3. The problem could not be replicated in support.We tried using Chrome,FF and IE browsers.

The aim of this problem record is to locate appropriate areas in code to ad logs which can help track the root cause of this problem.
The two possible causes for this issue is:-
1. The CIS screen is somehow skipped for some of the test instances.
2. The data from the screen is not saved intermittently in the database columns.

CaMLA has encountered a significant data integrity bug in Metrica.When adding a comment to an item, all non-ASCII characters in the item content are replaced with double-escaped HTML entities when the comment is saved. This greatly increases the risk of improperly formatted content appearing on CaMLA tests, and requires significant additional proofing work to make sure that does not happen. Fixing the issue is an urgent priority, as our ordinary workflow includes adding comments on hundreds of items per week.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create a new item or open an existing item.
2. Enter any non-ASCII character (e.g. é ’ —) in the item stimulus, prompt, or choices. Save the item.
3. Enter commenting mode. Create a new comment anywhere in the item content. Save the comment.

Result:
HTML entities now appear in the item content. This is due to double-escaping. The XML view reveals that non-ASCII characters that were previously directly represented in the XML are replaced with HTML entities, but with '&amp;' rather than a literal ampersand. For example this original text…
<simpleChoice identifier=""B"">at the café</simpleChoice>
…becomes…
<simpleChoice identifier=""B"">at the caf&amp;eacute;</simpleChoice>

Expected behavior:
Adding a comment should NEVER change other item content in any way.

CEE_B2_CT_L_End
CEE_B2_CT_L_Mid

Expected behaviour:

The B2 Competency listening tests have forward only navigation.  When the test is due to move on to the next item, a 5 second countdown timer appears at the top of the screen and counts down to zero.  At this point the user is moved on to the next screen.

Observed behaviour:

When the countdown gets to 2 seconds it moves the user on to the next screen.  It should only do this when the countdown has reached zero.

","APO Analysis:-
The issue is an intermittent one.This problem is not related to any test setups hence no code or data fix could be provided for this.The same tests which encountering the issue are showing expected results when we tried to replicate in support.
On further observation we found that the issue could be related to browser performances.The issue din't occur in browsers which are observably faster/smoother with cache already cleared.Also we would advise to use a system where the CPU consumption is low i.e. less number of applications are running at the time of taking the test.",Unable to replicate in SUP.

- The servers were created ~7 months ago, so if there was not a recent reboot then this could have contributed. The release instruction requested reboot, but cannot confirm if this actually happened.
- The upward memory trajectory started at 18:30hrs on Weds 28th April, which was the same time as wider network problems were encountered. This may be unrelated.",Unidentified cause,"No changes made, as problem no longer evident.

- To monitor server daily during the working week

Issue: User receives the below a runtime error when trying to navigate to Results in CEO.

Server Error in '/' Application.
________________________________
Runtime Error
Description: An application error occurred on the server. The current custom error settings for this application prevent the details of the application error from being viewed remotely (for security reasons). It could, however, be viewed by browsers running on the local server machine.

Details: To enable the details of this specific error message to be viewable on remote machines, please create a <customErrors> tag within a ""web.config"" configuration file located in the root directory of the current web application. This <customErrors> tag should then have its ""mode"" attribute set to ""Off"".

<!-- Web.Config Configuration File -->

<configuration>
    <system.web>
        <customErrors mode=""Off""/>
    </system.web>
</configuration>


Notes: The current error page you are seeing can be replaced by a custom error page by modifying the ""defaultRedirect"" attribute of the application's <customErrors> configuration tag to point to a custom error page URL.

<!-- Web.Config Configuration File -->

<configuration>
    <system.web>
        <customErrors mode=""RemoteOnly"" defaultRedirect=""mycustompage.htm""/>
    </system.web>
</configuration>



We have replicated the error with 3 separate centres. The error consistently occurs for me and an external user but not for another internal user that has tested.

Please can you investigate?

Note from Network Team (Email Also attached)
Hi Rahul,

In response to the task assigned to Networks team regarding the Automarker Façade service issue, I can confirm that there was a load balancer issue yesterday. 

The load balancer issue was quickly rectified but has obviously had some impact on certain services. Brian Simpson has been in communication with Grant, who has been advised to open a problem record.

The load balancer problem is under root cause investigation with our 3rd party support partners.

Regards,
Julian

Error:
[cid:image001.png@01D3D009.C80721B0]

Steps to replicate:


- Locate test in LIBS
- From 'Test details' tab, click:
- Create CBT > Preview CBT
- Error ""Socket Error #10061 Connection refused.""

Can you look into resolving this as soon as possible please?

None of the lines in the entry order have a QPV Set allocated.",Update the QPV set manually in the entry order-20067289.,"1.BPM System allowed creating multiple Entry orders for the same booking ID which is incorrect. This was a random occurrence happens in BPM. BRM table is maintained with the limitation of 500 entries for every minute result in multiple entry order creation for the same booking. Since the processes are running in parallel, when initial entries are submitted for creation, remaining entries were also picked for creation instead update. There is no track in system to save the interim response for the total entries submitted against the same booking until first process is getting completed.

2.QPV allocation failure message had triggered in ECC, since there is already one Named Entry Order- 20067288 available for Booking ID -11068094. System did not find any valid line items for QPV allocation for the new Entry Order- 20067289 created against the same booking.

1.Analysis for Multiple Entry Order creation: 

Issue occurs when more than 500 entries are submitted for a Booking at the same time. The entry controller picks entries to be processed in the batch of 500 entries for every 1 minute. The maximum entries to be picked i.e. 500 are maintained in the BRM table. 

Entry Order Creation Process :

 The booking details are fetched by the RFC - Z_EXP_RFC_GET_BOOKING_DETAILS and stored in rfcOutput. The entry order availability is checked for the booking from the output of Z_EXP_RFC_GET_BOOKING_DETAILS. If entry order is not available for the booking, then Z_EXP_RFC_CREATE_ENTRY_ORDER is called to create a new entry order and if entry order is already available for the booking, then Z_EXP_RFC_UPD_ENTRYORDER is called to update entry order that is available for the booking.
",Software Issue,"In order to avoid the above situation, entries breakup from BPM to be avoided (parameter value maintenance to be changed) since BPM Considers only first 500 initial entries for Order creation in parallel run. However the issue is occasional, changing the parameter value in future would result in performance issue. 

The aforesaid issue can be sorted, if the processes are scheduled in multiple runs instead of parallel run one after another by keeping an interim status for the total entries submitted against each Booking for Entry Order processing. A complete Impact Analysis to be carried out to accomplish the proposed change.

Hi there

Had a note from APO

I am pretty certain OCR Jan 2018 series consists of only CAMNAT but please can you double check with OCR that this series ( Jan 2018 ) does not require GCE, GCSE and GCSE (9-1)

For your two SRs

Refresh 1: This needs to happen on Wednesday 11th April. Please commence all qualification Rollback (Offline) & Rollback Verification (Offline) in readiness for a refresh. This is for the Jan 2018 exam series.

And

Refresh 1: This needs to happen on Thursday 12th April: Please load IFSMQ, L1 Foundation Project, L2 Higher Project, L3 Extended Project, Level 2 Award, Level 1&2 Cert, CAMNAT Award, CAMNAT Cert and CAMNAT Diploma results into the Active Results offline environment. This is for the Jan 2018 series.


Please note BTS personnel are also moving on those two days to the Triangle, therefore, there might be some delays or disruptions in communications (since our machines are being moved also at the same time!)

** Plus I am off on the 11th

-------------------------------------------------------

Hi BTS,

RM has investigated the logs and could see an unusual behaviour towards the end of the test. What they observed is wrong URL paths are requested during the exam by the test player, towards the end of the test.

The wrong URL paths requested are below:

'https://localhost:8080/test-content/css/jquery-ui.css'
'https://localhost:8080/test-content/css/banner.css'
'https://localhost:8080/test-content/css/navigation.css'
'https://localhost:8080/test-content/css/tools.css'
'https://localhost:8080/test-content/css/access.css'
'https://localhost:8080/test-content/css/base.css'
'https://localhost:8080/test-content/css/main.css'
'https://localhost:8080/test-content/css/item.css'
'https://localhost:8080/test-content/css/calc.css'
'https://localhost:8080/test-content/css/jquery.contextMenu.css'
'https://localhost:8080/test-content/css/chart.css'
'https://localhost:8080/test-content/css/notepad.css'
'https://localhost:8080/test-content/css/instructions.css'
'https://localhost:8080/test-content/js/theme.js'

Usually the above files are found in the below locations in test packages:

'https://localhost:8080/css/base.css'
'https://localhost:8080/css/jquery-ui.css'
'https://localhost:8080/css/navigation.css'
'https://localhost:8080/css/banner.css'
'https://localhost:8080/css/access.css'
'https://localhost:8080/css/main.css'
'https://localhost:8080/css/tools.css'
'https://localhost:8080/css/notepad.css'
'https://localhost:8080/css/chart.css'
'https://localhost:8080/css/calc.css'
'https://localhost:8080/css/item.css'
'https://localhost:8080/css/jquery.contextMenu.css'
'https://localhost:8080/css/instructions.css'
'https://localhost:8080/js/theme.js'

There seems to be some issue with the Test package\player because as you can see, the paths requested towards the end of the candidate's exam is from 'localhost:8080/test-content/css/*.css' instead of 'localhost:8080/css/*.css'

Could you please liaise with the package development team and ask them to investigate why this happened?

ZD578311 - Connect Plus: Candidate is out of Contact

RM said that they have seen this behaviour before and Informed CA as part of ICC 5328124 (closed ICC). We believe the CA package team is working on it. Could you please let us know the progress of that investigation?

We are not able to pin point a cause for the issue mentioned, because the details regarding individual drag and drop components are not logged in the ConnectPlus logs, as they are part of the test-package.

However, we could see that the candidate has answered questions 10,11,12 and 14 before he/she was logged in for the second time (after reboot).

After the reboot, we could see that the candidate could answer the remaining two questions (9 and 13).

The drag and drop components that the candidate used to answer the questions 10,11,12 and 14 ,before the reboot, will not be visible in the 'draggables' section at this point of time, as they were used already. So, it could be the case that the drag-and-drop item that went 'missing' after the reboot was already dropped into a 'droppable'.

Since we are not provided which particular question faced the issue, it is difficult to proceed the investigation in a particular direction.

Could you please have the package team look into this issue and let us know of their findings ?

It has also been reported and consequently speculated as the system bypassed the confirmation of the result. Result progresses without allowing the user to provide the marks in confirmation stage (Second entry).,Result progresses automatically,"This defect is encountered when remarking the results of a candidate whose previous results were received from Mark Manager. During remark, after the First Entry scores are submitted, IWAS transitions the Writing component to Second Entry, but does not clear the First Entry data. In the back end, the RESULT_WRITING table still holds the First Entry data (eg. scores, task 1 user id, task 2 user id) and RW_STATE is set to SECOND_ENTRY. IWAS also inserts a new row to the RESULT_WRITING_STATE table to audit FIRST_ENTRY scores. At this stage, since scores are entered manually, IWAS should have cleared the data (eg. scores, task 1 user id, task 2 user id) in the RESULT_WRITING table.

In effect, when another user goes to the Confirm Results page, it would appear that the Writing Scores have already been confirmed. The second user confirms the remaining components (Listening, Reading, and Speaking) and IWAS transitions all components appropriately. However, IWAS inserts an incorrect RESULT_WRITING_STATE record for the confirmed Writing Scores (this explains the problem reported in both INC-594980 and INC-583544).

This defect applies only to the Writing component because of a special case for retaining the task1/task2 scores when they are received from Mark Manager. If the scores are received from Mark Manager, scores are retained, otherwise scores are cleared so that the scores could be confirmed by another user. To check if the scores came from Mark Manager, IWAS reads the data from RESULT_WRITING.RW_SOURCE.

Please can the root cause be investigated?  From Monday onwards we are going to be running an additional marker monitoring service for OCR with a dependency on ODS and SAS – this is part of a formal “undertaking” which Saul has made to  OCR’s regulator, Ofqaul, and so it’s particularly important that it runs smoothly.

This is working correctly on the Live Cambridge English website except for the top-level Learning English page and the activities pages under that.
I have also verified that this problem is occurring in UAT. The testing in UAT is summarized as follows:
UAT testing: 3 test cases
  1) GA ID unset, GTM ID set in Tridion
      Main site: Correct - No GA tagging.GTM appears

This Message belows came from Lucian Nimigean (8x8 Support)

This message is in regards to your 8x8 Support case C1267070 - Customer Requested Hold.

Thank you again for running all of the tests for us. As agreed yesterday, I have reviewed all of the available data and also involved our Ops technical team to double-check my assumptions and results.

I can confirm that the test results look good. The fact that there was higher latency to our UK datacenter compared to HK or US, as it is in your case, won't represent a problem when you are going to use 8x8 with our proprietary application called Virtual Office Desktop (VOD). VOD uses a proprietary technology called geo-routing, which basically ensures all calls using the app will be routed to the closest datacenter, latency-wise. The tests you did using VOD confirmed there were no call quality problems reported. 

With all this in mind, my technical suggestion would be to have everyone move to using VOD in order to solve any latency issues you are experiencing at this point in time after your move from UK to Manila. If you consider going forward with this plan, I would have to defer any questions you might have in regards to the contract, financial side and legals, to my colleague Andy Needham who is handling your account from these perspectives.


Thanks again for all your help and looking forward to hearing back from you!

It has been noticed that it generally happens when candidate is transferred to another session. Since the new session in which the candidate has been transferred already occupies the total provisional volume with confirmed candidates (online confirmed volume), the online confirmed volume increases compared to the provisional volume to account for the inclusion of the new candidate in this session and pending count decreases to the negative values to counter the increment in confirmed volume so that these both can ultimately be in sync with the provisional volume count.

After the release of first batch of candidates, IWAS will still find some candidates in UNCONFIRMD, UNVALIDATED or VALIDATING status and would trigger the PRRC email.","After validation completes PRC and uploads the spreadsheet, IWAS executes the following steps in the current world:

1.       Determines and saves result release date based on test date selected as input. 
2.       Withhold candidates. If there are candidates to be withheld, IWAS changes the status of the candidates to WITHHELD
3.       Release the remaining candidates. IWAS changes the status of the remaining candidates to released.
4.       Determines which centres are eligible to receive PRRC mails. If a centre has got any candidates either in UNCONFIRMD, UNVALIDATED or VALIDATING status, that centre is eligible to receive PRRC emails.
5.       Send emails to the centres.

We got this issue because, after step 3, the candidates uploaded in the spreadsheet will either move to RELEASED or WITHHELD status. That mean when IWAS will execute step4, if it doesn’t find any candidate with UNCONFIRMD, UNVALIDATED or VALIDATING status, it will not consider the centre for those candidates to receive PRRC mails. 

Before R5, the logic was slightly different. IWAS use to check UNCONFIRMD, UNVALIDATED or VALIDATING candidates before and after changing the result status. Pre R5 logic was:

1.       Determines and saves result release date based on test date selected as input. 
2.       Determines which centres are eligible to receive PRRC mails. If a centre has got any candidates either in UNCONFIRMD, UNVALIDATED or VALIDATING status, that centre is eligible to receive PRRC emails.
3.       Save the list of centres into a SET (java term).
4.       Withhold candidates. If there are candidates to be withheld, IWAS changes the status of the candidates to WITHHELD
5.       Release the remaining candidates. IWAS changes the status of the remaining candidates to released.
6.       Determines which centres are eligible to receive PRRC mails. If a centre has got any candidates either in UNCONFIRMD, UNVALIDATED or VALIDATING status, that centre is eligible to receive PRRC emails.
7.       Save the list of centres determined in step 6 in the SET created in step 3.

This is the probable reason to this problem. As for the 'Level 3 Certificate', user is not expected to enter a first and sixth grade as judgemental (so not null), but user provides a separate judgemental grades to second and fifth grades.

Please can this be investigated as a matter of utmost urgency. This MUST being fixed and successfully regraded by the close of business tomorrow 08/08/2018.

In some, the candidates are unable to listen to their own voice during the Audio check at the start of the test and in others, the speaking test Part 2 read aloud text is not as it should appear resulting in improper answers which the examiners find difficult to mark and in some cases, Examiners faced all the Candidate responses blank. Their broader categorization are as follows:

1. Some mismatches are reported between the speaking text displayed and the question numbers making it difficult for the examiners to mark them.
Incident – 593451, 585800
Centre: JP500
BULATS Speaking Token: SE6QKGTCUW. During Part 2 of the speaking test, candidate reported that for questions 3 and 4 the text they needed to read and speak was not displayed in the box. They claimed that when they log the candidate out of the test and back in it continued a Part 3 rather than the remaining Part 2 questions. Candidate Responses are not matching with the question texts meaning that either the question displayed to the centre was different than what was mapped to them or some other issues. Some discrepancies are evident from the Candidate responses as well.
 
2. 593465. 
Centre – JP500. This Centre ran 42 Speaking tests using test version EN384 on Friday the 6th. Some of candidates complained that the questions were not displayed correctly.  Specifically some words were blank (= space).  For instance on Part 2 Q.8 the examiner found ""2:00pm"" was not displaying. You can confirm this situation with TOKEN SWK5TZ8BP7 on Part 2, Question 8. Further investigations revealed that the tasksysref was loaded with proper questions and texts as it should.

3. 592920 – 
Centre: JP500. BULATS, Speaking, Token: S57CDU22VM. In part 2 of this candidate's test the first sentences are fine but later on (from the 6th question) the candidate is speaking not the question they are given but the one after. Please can you investigate why this might be the case with particular reference to BTS Incident 585800 where centre JP500 also has an issue with BULATS questions apparently not matching the answers.

4. 588183 – 
Centre: MX475. BULATS - Unable to proceed past Record check. Candidates report that the record button got greyed out even after they allowed the microphone access at the start of the test.

5. 600332 – 
Centre: JP500. Candidate audio is overlapped with each other making them unsuitable for marking.

6.  616115 - 
Centre: JP500. BULATS, Speaking, Token: SKBT6NMZH3. Candidate responses are all blank.

7.  620532 - 
Centre: JP500. BULATS, Speaking, Token: SWVP523H99.

This however happens all the time. My belief if, EPS should only do calculations and overwrite value when the grade is not a Judgemental. in this case, even Manual Overwrite checkbox doesn't help.

It is this temp id that is used during the check to identify if cand is eligible  for CCA cert.

In the present incident, a candidate entry has been observed to have been submitted from the CIE Direct application where the following Assessment – Option mapping is seen to have been submitted by the centre user using the CIE Direct Finalentries application. The below snapshot depicts the fact that the first entry was proper and not having any Option Code. Later the amendment is shown to have been submitted for Assessment 1113 and BX option code.

","The affected entry should first be filtered off if the parent centre checks the entry CSV before approving. If the centre is not a sub-centre or the parent centre approved the entry with the incorrect mapping, then the entry needs to be corrected from EPS end so that the corrected value flows back to CIE Direct via EPS – CIE push process.","• We have replicated the same scenario in DEV environment. The error is due to the NULL teaching group code for an entry and not due to the option code(as mentioned in the PR). Attached screens are from the PR itself which describes the issue.
• From final entries application, user cannot insert null or incorrect teaching group code as it is validated against mapped teaching group code (populated from EPS). Moreover, wrong option code cannot be inserted for an entry as users are given options to choose from a list of valid option code.
• So, we are assuming that the error scenario can occur only if EPS pushes an entry with null teaching group code for Primary Checkpoint/Checkpoint qualifications or the mapping itself is incorrect (null teaching group code mapped with PC/C qualifications).

Looking at the above facts, it is seen that this is a data issue. So, to prevent this scenario EPS should validate and prevent pushing null teaching group code (with an entry or in the mapping table)for Checkpoint qualifications to Direct database.

We were unable to end test for candidate 001219 for Test date 5 July 18 from the NZ150 TSA. Status showed as Ending for around 8-9 minutes.

We manually PAUSED the entire test after around 10 minutes after which the ‘Ending’ status became ‘Ended’ for that candidate.

Severity:High

Details: 

Test Centre: Pilot NZ150

Test Taker: 001219

Test Section: Listening

Sitting: 3

Issue Description:

-          Test was Paused approx. 3mins into the test commencing for all candidates (‘Overview’ tab by clicking Pause button in the Test Controls against the AC Listening section)
-          Test was Resumed after a few minutes
-          Completed answering all 40 test questions for 001219 - Listening
-          Ended test for this individual test taker at approx. 20 minutes left from the “Candidates” tab. After a few minutes, the test still had not ended so we waited and took some photos (attached) of the TSA and CW. The status displayed as ‘Ending’
-          The test showed ‘Ending’ status for about 8-9 minutes after which we did not wait any longer.
-          Paused test again for all candidates using Pause button in Overview tab with the hope that it would End test of candidate 001219 at approx 11mins (as test still had not ended for test taker)
-          After pausing the test, we could now see that the Test Taker’s Listening test had Ended
-          Resumed test after a few seconds, but test had ended for Test Taker, and it did not resume for them.
-          Collected the logs as per procedure for CW and TSA and uploaded them to the FTP server on 5 July.
-          Snapshots attached.

Note: We have been able to end tests for other candidates on the same CW normally without any issue before and after this incident.


RM have investigated this issue and advise: -

We could not see any Connection problems logged in the CW for this test date.

But we could see that the times set in the TSA and CW were different. For example, the candidate login is logged at 19:23 in the TSA but 17:22 in the CW. 

We believe the CW time is 2 hours behind the TSA time. Considering that, we could see that the test was ended at 19:45:21 and this reached the CW at 19:55 (After considering the time difference).

When we checked the corresponding time in the logs of the CW, what we could see that, at 19:43 (Logged at 17:43 in the logs, but we considered the time difference again) , a particular audio file,ILI20246EVO-1-0-1.OGG, was requested by the test player. This same scenario happened for another audio file,ILI30213EVO-0-0-1.OGG, at 19:50.

One possible scenario we can think of is that, due to these requests, the CW/test froze and did not receive the test end message from the TSA. After a while, that is just under 10 minutes, the CW recovered and responded to the test end message.

Could you please have a look into this from the test player end and let us know if there is anything odd in these requests ?

Message from Liam Cameron:
These drives cannot be touched until the AV Unit has had their data transferred to the new server. The drive does not need to be expanded but nothing should be erased either.

For the time being, alerting should be turned off for this Server/Drive as I suggested months ago when these incidents first started coming my way. I am happy to take ownership of a PR until I have managed to migrate their data, at which point I will reassign to our Servers team so they can erase the data and re-enable alerting, depending on actions taken on the back of the above incident. 

In conclusion, I recommend we convert this to a PR, turn off alerting for the storage in Foglight (we’d still like to see if the OS crashes etc.) and I’ll take ownership of the PR once it’s raised.

Subject: Interchange Claim Problems

Can you check if there's a problem record for this:

3 incidents (that we can recall numbers for, we know there were a few more) raised regarding the same issue. When a moderator goes in to process the claim, not all candidates are showing. Different centres, moderators etc. Most are checking with us first but Ant had a moderator who needed to withdraw a candidate who wasn't showing. Rather than report it he/she processed the claim and just added a note into the centre feedback report resulting in an issue report.

If there are ESM Remarks outstanding, each BizTalk thread will pick these up and both threads are processed by ESM.  This results in duplicate data being created in ESM.",When BizTalk is re-started after downtime BizTalk will introduce a delay when starting parallel threads.,"Problem statement : 
On Saturday 22/09/18, all remark requests which were uploaded through ESM were duplicated.
At around 11.30am a CSV of 721 requests was uploaded. These did not appear on RM until about 4pm and the entire file was duplicated (1442).

Root cause:  

RCA for delay in syncing RM: Due to RFC 31187 BizTalk environment was completely shut down 2 times. Roughly BizTalk environment was brought down at 2018-09-22 10:01:35.410 and re-enabled at 2018-09-22 15:35:07.423
Hence even though CSV uploaded in ESM around 11.30am , but the Remark requests reached RM reached around 4 PM. 

RCA for duplicate in RM: 
Once the  BizTalk environment was brought online, within a few millisecond interval 2 parallel BizTalk processes polled ESM for pending Remark requests in order to sync RM. Both the parallel threads of ESM polling received identical response (721 remark requests) from ESM Remark service. As BizTalk process received 721 remark requests in 2 separate threads from ESM, it send RM the same 721 remarks twice. Ideally ESM Remark service should not return same data in the 2 parallel threads.
",Known/standard error,"Change ESM to process BizTalk mulit-threading without creating duplicate Remark Requests in ESM.

On discussion with the business and the Integration team it has been agreed that this PR can be closed. Single threaded BizTalk has coped with 15,000 records in summer series 2017with no issues.  Any more than 6,000 records would be exceptional.  Summer 2016 processing volumes was exceptional and is unlikely to be repeated.

Subject: Centralising in Xopus

Hi Jim,

We've got an unusual one regarding alignment in Xopus. When you centralise text such as a title, it doesn't appear to centre.

The example we've noticed this on in 11_8021_11 2019 (8036a85a).

Xopus (white space has been added in an effort to shift the text over:
[cid:image001.png@01D406FF.4F5D9FF0]

Render (I've printed this out from a local printer and measured accordingly):
[cid:image002.png@01D40700.73364D40]

As you can see, the 3 is not fully centralised. It sits just to the left of the centre point of the page. Therefore, even if the text below was centralising correctly, it would appear off set because of the number alignment.

The text (the bit being referred to) even with the white space work around, is not fully centralised. This issue is causing PMs to comment in the mark-up which then requires text production to try and 'fudge' a fix. This is then causing inconsistencies with output across a suite of papers.

Is this something  you could look into?
Many thanks,

Nick

In short, the issue is that for some centres, EPS is charging incorrect fees.
Example attached as email on the PR
As you can see, user is expecting £73 to be charged instead of £52.",None. User needs to handle this themselves,"To identify the amount EPS needs to charge, EPS follows below:
1.       Identifies the product range through which centre is taking the syllabus
2.       Identifies the payer contact of the product range 
3.       Then finds out the Accounting Region of the contact
4.       In this case (reported on incident), the Accounting Region is Jordan
5.       As per Financial Regions screen shot (refer to email), Jordan is part of “Int Sterling Fee Sheet C”
6. “Int Sterling Fee Sheet C” is set up to £52
6.       Hence, value of 52 is picked on the invoice

As per user, Fee should be charged for the country where the exam takes place. The test centre and not the accounting centre is the fee sheet that needs to be used. In the example on Incident, although Jordan are paying, the exam was taken in the UAE.  Therefore, the correct fee should have been £73.

So, the cause of the issue is that EPS is charging as per a logic that user's don't agree

Disks attached to prd-vios2 are configured with 8x paths - 4x via each of fscsi0 and fscsi2.

Although 4x paths is considered quite adequate for most scenarios, best practice dictates single points of failure should be avoided.
It seems likely there should have been paths provided via another interface to prd-vios1.

Please have SAN mapping and zoning checked and/or updated.

I was patching a couple of servers in the QA1 environment on Monday night and both started off well enough, but eventually hung completely. When looking at task manager, I could see that the HIIS service was consuming all the memory on both servers. I had to cancel the installation eventually, but unfortunately one of the servers is now corrupted and will need to be rebuilt. 

Recently, we’ve come across a number of servers with corrupt installations in the QA1 environment, and all are exhibiting the same errors that I see on the recently broken installation. 

I’ve done a little research and can see that there does appear to be a known issue with a memory leak with HIIS and “unsupported” versions of SQL. Unsupported by McAfee, that is:

https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB81968

I was installing SQL Server 2016 SP2, which apparently isn’t supported according to this somewhat dated link:

https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB65845

The first link suggests a workaround of disabling HIIS on the SQL Server service while patching. Is this feasible? I assume it will require someone from Security to disable.

So far, we’ve only seen corrupted installation in the QA1 environment.

The top controller of SAN31C then experienced an unexpected reboot and after raising with Dell (SR#974673656) they believe the speed mismatch was the cause of this.

The bottom controller of SAN31C is getting intermittent IPC errors 
So far we have (in no particular order): 
• re-seated various fibres
• replaced various fibres
• fibre inspection for all non-structured fibre utilised for bottom controller ports 1 and 3
• performed end-to-end attenuation tests on bottom controller ports 1 and 3 which proved the run of fabric, including the structured, is good
• both controllers have been swapped with warranty replacements 
• firmware updates (this caused the IPC errors to move from top controller to the bottom controller)
• BMC was misconfigured on one controller (one had a 169.254.x.x address and the other had 192.168.x.x) I rectified this which allowed the SAN to pass a remote health check performed by Dell, but didn’t resolve the IPC errors.

• The Standard Change that triggered this incident has been implemented hundreds of times since DirectAccess was deployed in around 2014.  It has never gone wrong or had any undesirable impact.  It is very low risk.
• We have no reason to believe the engineer made an error during the change.  From experience, I believe he could have clicked all the wrong buttons but still not caused the result we have experienced.
• The cause is very likely to be a software bug.
• With Microsoft’s help we will establish root cause.  We will also identify architectural options to reduce the impact of issues in future, and explore options for monitoring to identify such an issue faster in future.

The technical detail of what happened…

• In implementing the Standard Change, a simple DNS entry was added to the DirectAccess configuration.  Copy/paste activity.  When the engineer clicks “apply”, DirectAccess automatically applies that setting directly in to two “Group Policies”  in AD.  That change then replicates around all of the Domain Controllers, and client computers (laptops in this case) check in for updates/changes every 4 hours.
• On this occasion, for some reason DirectAccess literally emptied one of the two key policies.  All content was removed from it - automatically.  This isn’t something the engineer will have been able to see.  Through the day this empty policy replicated around the Domain Controllers, and clients downloaded the empty policy.  At that moment, the laptops with the new policies lose any knowledge of DirectAccess.
• We fixed the issue by restoring the original policy from a backup

Current status
• Any laptops that received the “empty” policy who DO connect to a Cambridge Assessment network (Triangle, Coventry, internationals) will automatically receive the policy.  DirectAccess will automatically work when they restart and connect from home/away.
• Any laptops that received the “empty” policy who DO NOT connect to a CA network (home workers) sadly will not automatically get the policy and will not be able to connect to DirectAccess.  Fixing this will not be trivial - somehow we have to get a complex policy applied to a computer we have zero access to

Cosmos hits a 'Processing Error' when it gets to the 'Start parsing XML' stage and then stops processing. Upon checking the file we found that there is no centre or candidate information.

The reason for this is that Cosmos is moving the files before EPSp has finished writing the data. This error happened previously which is when we discovered the root cause when consulting with Canon. 

It was decided that a wait time would be set in Cosmos so that there was a delay between Cosmos noticing a new file in \\ucles.external\ResultsOnlineprd$\XmlDumpDirectory and it moving the file to the new jobs folder.

Also we couldn’t debug this as we couldn’t produce any data to debugging. 

I spoke to the operations admin (Kasia Wilkes) who approved the withdrawal from UWL, and she confirmed that this was because the centre sent the candidate twice, and this brought it to my attention that there is a possibility that when the candidate was approved initially, it was delayed in the backend to get processed and that prompted centre to resend the candidate which eventually duplicated the credit memo request.

My conclusion would be that we close the PR.

In ATC REST layer the HttpClient used to send ATP response to IWAS is not closed (RestClient.java).
As UNIX like operating systems treat network connections like files, and they use file descriptors [REF 1, REF 2].
So for the system - not closing a network connection is equivalent to, a file being left open. This increases the number of open files count for the system. Once the maximum number of open files permitted for the process is exceeded, the issue surfaces.

rules reinstated under Standard Change# 33061.,"Root cause for this PR is human error contributed to by Production server names and IP addresses being used in a Non-Production environment.

Service request #196105 requested firewall rules related to SAS in the Threshold PP1 (THR-PP1) environment be decommissioned.  The server names and IP addresses used in THR-PP1 match Production.  The Network Engineer who fulfilled the service request incorrectly removed rules/objects relating to Production SAS on the Staging and Production firewalls.  The firewall policies were then installed under scheduled Standard Change 33016 on the morning of Saturday 19th January.  Subsequently some services and clients were unable to communicate with Production SAS, resulting in P2 incident 643407, resolved by re-instating the firewall rules under Standard Change 33061. ",Skills/knowledge issue,"1) Education - remind all of Network Team that removal of PRD-related firewall rules or objects on STG and PRD firewalls must be done under Normal RFC, in line with rules relating to PRD servers.
2) Education - conduct a dedicated Tech Session for the Networks Team to review the network architecture of the THR-PP1 environment - in particular the use of conflicting names & IP addresses, and potential risks associated.
3) Process Change - when implementing decommission request for any environment, the Network Engineer must check (via ping & other means) whether the servers/systems being impacted have already been decommissioned.  If in any doubt, the engineer should halt the work and check with the requestor or other relevant colleague.  Escalate to Team Lead or SLT if any uncertainty remains.
4) Process Change - Decommissioning activities should be implemented under one consolidated Change (RFC) to ensure that all technical teams involved are aware, and the tasks are orchestrated to provide simple and fast roll-back.",Training

occurring for a particular case (Inserting multi part yellow label packets)

","1. Updating yellow label Packets:
When STS_ITEM_UPDATE.UPDATE_PKT_ITEM_DESCRIPTIONS procedure is called from the function body of DO_LOAD_PACKET_TABLE, the argument passed in the mentioned procedure is the item_id of the particular multi-part packet which is creating the problem. Screen-shot attached (RCA_Update_action.png). It should be passing the partMaster_Itemid as argument.

update forms_NQF1Detail set UnitNo='' where ID= @ID
","The Interchange Cambridge Technicals Entry functionality checks if an Entry for the scheme code already exists in Interchange. If Yes, then system deletes the existing entry record and makes a new Entry against the scheme code as Re-Entry with code ‘0R’.
Therefore the Move Up /Down is made with Re-Entry code can be made for the following scenarios:
1.       User makes Move up entry for a scheme say ‘5824U’ and mistakenly makes the move up entry for the same scheme ‘5824U’ again. In this case the earlier entry record gets deleted and new record gets inserted
for scheme code ‘5824U’ as Re-Entry (i.e. with ‘0R’). Same happens for Move down.

2.       Candidate makes move up down within family in such way that same scheme has been moved up /down twice e.g.  05825-> 5824D -> 5825U-> 5824D. Here the second entry made for 5824D is inserted as Re-Entry. However, this appears to be very rare scenario, though you need to confirm this.

This problem impacts unit entry attempt count (due to the re-entry code with Move Up/Down). 
E.g. Candidate sits for 05825 and makes 1 unclassified attempt at tested unit 1, then moves down to 05824 (where the move down entry has been made twice mistakenly, resulting move down with re-entry code’0R’) . Now even if candidate makes the second unclassified attempt of unit 1 under 05824, it gets treated as 1st attempt due to the ‘0R’ re-entry code and full Unclassified award won’t get generated in this case.

Details are below.<br><br>Description of Issue:<br>Exporting a pdf of a test in Firefox results in an unrecognized file with a truncated file name (works without issue in Chrome)<br><br>Priority level: P3<br><br>Impact on users/work:<br>We currently do not have a single browser for all our content production functionality (some things work in Chrome, and others in Firefox at this point). Exporting test pdfs and html bundles is a part of daily work at Michigan Language Assessment, and we have no other way to export the content of our items than to export as a pdf or html file from a test form.

By design, MSMQ disconnects every five minutes of inactivity and waits 60 seconds before attempting to reconnect. During this wait time, any Responder communication attempts would result in reach queue timeout errors.
",Software Issue,"Jira item MEPS-293 created.

1. To alleviate this issue, Microsoft recommends setting the wait time to 4 seconds (rather than the default setting of 60). 
2. Open the Registry and browse to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\MSMQ\Parameters.
3. Right-click the Parameters key and select New > DWORD value.
4. Name this DWORD value: WaitTime.
5. Right-click WaitTime and select Modify.
6. Set the Value Data field to the number of seconds (e.g., 4) MSMQ should wait before attempting to reconnect.

New booking will be created and status will be changed to ‘Amendment in progress’ and then to ‘Confirmed’. All the status changes are done by BPMUSER and not by network allocation process.

In order to make the network allocation process to confirm the booking status, Status change by BPMUSER should be restricted. Restricting ‘Confirmed’ status change alone will not allow the network allocation process to confirm the booking. So ‘Amendment in progress’ status change should also be restricted for BPMUSER. 

Booking status Amendment in progress and Confirmed change should be restricted in RFC Z_PRE_UPDATE_STATUS for BPM user. This will prevent booking gets confirmed by BPMUSER and allow network allocation process to confirm the booking.

This status change restriction makes bookings gets disappeared from CECP until it gets confirmed.  In order to make the booking gets displayed in CECP during amendment, Booking order no and schedule 25 date should get updated in ZPRE_VBAP table.

New RFC Z_PRE_UPD_BOOKING_NO should be created to update ZPRE_VBAP table with Booking Order No(VBELN) and Schedule 25 date (SCH_DATE_25) with system date temporarily in order to make the bookings visible in CECP. Later after booking confirmation, network allocation process will update the SCH_DATE_25 date from activity FSDE2S (As per the existing design).

RFC Z_PRE_UPD_BOOKING_NO should be called in BPM orchestration process during booking amendment after the RFC - Z_EXP_RFC_CREATE_BOOK_ORDER call to pass input parameter as VBELN (which is created from create booking rfc).In case of any error retry mechanism should be handled for 3 times.",Request for Change

QPVIDs were then replayed successfully by script which was confirmed by integration team however the issue persisted in the C+ end&nbsp; which meant exams could not be downloaded causing the examinations to be cancelled. APO team have attached evidence document and explained further investigation is required by the C+ team to determine why the re-pushed content was not downloadable. <br>",No workaround the centres abandoned their tests,"content wasn't available because the third feed was sent before we processed the second one, wp34 should sort that",Third Party/External issue,"Script was run and content appeared in C plus but did not load to centres

Not successful due to sequence issue for unusual processing, assessed as a one off.

And the workaround was to adjust the data to make the whole thing a white label.  And although we don’t know the overall root cause of why EPS behaved this way, the analysis by Cognizant Support makes the following points: (1) STS is working properly (2) the incident is fully resolved (3) the root cause from an STS perspective has been identified as bad data from EPS, and (4) this is rare.

2. PE was assigned to the panel in EPS and assignments were submitted on ESM
3. PE was later changed to become an examiner in the same panel BUT ESM was not updated to reflect the same
4. My understanding is scenario like #3 warrants a manual intervention when panel administrator requests BTS for the change to be reflected in ESM assignments.
5. Because Step # 4 didn’t take place – in ESM the hierarchy became circular and hence we received 100% CPU hikes.
6. BTS was informed on 6th June to modify the panel in ESM and after 6th June we haven’t seen any CPU hikes.",Process Failure,"Ensure the correct existing business process is followed within panels team.

2) In case there is possibility of high volume of next sets of jobs appearing, stop those hotfolder in order to reduce the reduce the jobs to be ingested in COSMOS.
- This will reduce the number of jobs in COSMOS, resulting the no further load on COSMOS
3) Setting the priority on jobs [This did not work as par past experience]
4) Stopping the service of COSMOS [This also did not help, since the number of jobs will remain same]

As a result the backup file size is increasing and subsequent backup time is increasing. Once the database log file size increases it occupies more disk space and the messagebox db fails to work for lack of space in the disk. Once this happens the whole BizTalk processing shuts down impacting all the flows.,"As a temporary workaround the  followed things were done:
1> Stop all processing in BizTalk
2> Increase the diskspace in the impacted database server
3> let the backup of the logs complete
4> shrinks the log file
5. kill the running backup job and start a fresh one.","On further analysis, what is found is:
1> The backjob is running on the primary server instead of the secondary.
2> The most used database Bamprimary DB is regularly hitting high 90% CPU.
3> The allocated diskspace for messagebox dbs is not adequate in high load scenario.

Subject: Multiple Foglight Alert - AG Not Synchronizing

Hi Team,

Good morning!

There are multiple 'AG not synchronizing' Foglight alert in our DT queue this morning.
Our initial checks with the rest of the PRD servers seems fine.
However, AGs SSEPRDAG01 (Inc#680853) and ODSPRDAG01 (Inc680858) are having issues with AG synchronization as of this moment.

Manila DBAs are currently working on these AGs and we would like to request for your support if there are any issues on your side which can help us resolve this issue.

[cid:image001.jpg@01D51F90.2AA38990]

[cid:image002.jpg@01D51F90.2AA38990]

We will create a new task assigned to you under these incidents.

Thank you.

Kind regards

ESM SUP database: SSJNTSQ008\SQL01
This issue happens only once for Report Id 50371, under incident 691921.
So we have replayed the same Report Id in ESM SUP environment by changing the ReportStateId to 10 (i.e. Pending) in Payment.ReportRow table and by making required modification in related tables like : Payment.MarkerActivityPending, Payment.ReportRowActivity etc. under MarkerPaymentsV2 database.
 And by running two windows services hosted in support server ssjntis001 - 
i) ESM WCF Services Host
ii) ESM Marker Payments Processor
But the duplicate rows were not same all the time.
Every time we found different rows having itemwise marker and payment information in duplicate. So it is very difficult to find out the exact data issue.
As this is an intermittent issue and happens only once, so it will be better to keep an eye for further monitoring.
",Data Issue,"Workaround is in place to manually delete duplicate rows from required payment report (Here, Report ID : 50371) and sent it to customer.  

Further investigation was underway in Jira entry ESM-119 with RCA SR# 213963. This is an issue that has occurred once for a particular Report ID which was manually resolved.

The issue is not replicable in support environment and appears to be a one off .  This information was taken to the dev group who were happy to close the PR and should this issue re-occur raise a new record.",None

Hi Ganta,
Thank you for your time earlier, as discussed and agreed, please implement the following fix against the ZBW_INQUIRY_ORDERS datasource to resolve the above issue, accordingly. The IN has been outstanding for some time now and so it is imperative the development of the fix is started asap with a view for production deployment this week (w/e 29th March).


1.       Set lower limit value

[cid:image001.jpg@01D4E570.953F79D0]


2.       In the function module of the datasource, in the Loop where the ranges are filled in (see below), add the code where OPTION = 'GE' for each of the range tables - SDD1, SDDT2, SDDT3 and SDDT4, so that it would select data where Created On and Changed On is greater than or equal to the timestamp.

[cid:image002.png@01D4E570.953F79D0]



Amend the loop with below, for each of the ranges:-



loop AT S_S_IF-T_SELECT INTO L_S_SELECT WHERE FIELDNM = 'AEDAT'.

move-CORRESPONDING l_s_select to sddt1.

sddt1-OPTION = 'GE'.
      append sddt1.

.

.

.
endloop.



3.       In the function module of the datasource, in the select statement, apply below change.

Select ...

Where auart = 'ZBOK'

and        a~vbeln in sdno

and        (a~erdat in sddt1 OR a~aedat in sddt2)

and        (b~erdat in sddt3 OR b~aedat in sddt4)



Any questions/clarification please let me know.

In Metrica we have noticed that if a user has the senior examiner role and has been nominated for a product as a senior examiner then they can't access marking sessions  for that product.

They see the message: You can no longer access this marking session as your examiner status is currently suspended due to a Still Unsatisfactory rating.

[cid:image002.jpg@01D54EA1.9E8B7B20]

However they are not suspended and don't have a Still Unsatisfactory rating.

[cid:image005.png@01D54E9F.8E20AB90]


Example in QA
Example senior examiner
SSDExaminer0208

Marking Session example
Linguaskill General Speaking default marking session

The examiner has passed certification and before been approved as a senior examiner they did have access to the marking session:

[cid:image007.png@01D54E9F.8E20AB90]

However after been approved as a senior examiner they can no longer access the marking session and see the error mentioned above.

This also occurs if you have a senior examiner who has not gone through the examiner certification process first.

Please could you look into why upgrading a user to senior examiner stops them from accessing the marking session?

Thank you

result PDF generation process in CIE CM fails if there are unsupported

unsupported characters cause failure for the entire cohort. As a workaround, all
the candidate names are scanned for unsupported characters and corrected prior
to result pdf generation to ensure smooth generation of result pdf. The data
also is corrected in EPS, as otherwise there is always a chance of incorrect
data flowing back to Direct database. The remit of this PR is to investigate

"Created Problem Records for Selected Services, Total 1865",7382,Investigation,CE Exam Processing,Metrica - CE,5,Cambridge English ,06/09/2019 15:08:01,,FAO Mterica APO Team - Candidate responses not been returned to the marking pool,"Hello,<br /><br />In JIRA https://metrica.atlassian.net/browse/MET-7758 the functionality was introduced to return a candidate response to the examiner marking pool if the examiner the response was assigned to has not submitted a mark and one of the following occur:<br /><br /><br />  1.  When an examiner logout occurs (initiated by the examiner), as part of that logout, the system must immediately de-allocate any items that are still allocated to that examiner<br />  2.  When an examiner logout is forced by the system (after 20mins of inactivity), allocated items must remain allocated until the system timeout of 3hrs (see next bullet). This will enable an examiner to log in again and recommence marking if so required.<br />  3.  The system must also monitor allocation periods, with a timeout of 3hrs for an allocated item - the monitoring script can run every 30 minutes. Any items allocated for more than 3hrs must be de-allocated, regardless of login state.<br /><br />It states that any item that is de-allocated must be automatically returned to the respective marking pool for reallocation and the returned item must become the next item in the pool that is awaiting marking (first in the queue).<br /><br />After some testing in Live QA a query has arisen as to whether or not this functionality is working or not.<br /><br />In the Linguaskill General Speaking DMS it has been observed that items are not returned to the pool when not marked by the examiner they were originally allocated to.<br /><br />For example yesterday examiner AP_ExaminerQA1 say a part 2 response but didn't  mark it. Today when logging in as APExaminerQA2 the examiner sees the message that there are no items to be marked.<br /><br />If the return to pool functionality was working we believe that the response should be available to APExaminerQA2 for marking.<br /><br />Please could you investigate and see if this functionality is indeed working or not?<br /><br />Please note I am out of the office until the 27th August please could you cc Annabelle Pinnington Pinnington.A@cambridgeenglish.org<mailto:Pinnington.A@cambridgeenglish.org> into any replies on this.<br /><br />Thank you<br /><br />Best Regards<br />Becca<br /><br />Rebecca Patrick<br />Systems Support Specialist<br />T: +44 (0) 1223 553039<br />The Triangle Building, Shaftesbury Road, Cambridge, CB2 8EA<br /><br />Cambridge Assessment English<br />Part of the University of Cambridge<br />www.cambridgeenglish.org<http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/>",,,,"<ExaminerItemDeallocationElapsedTime></ExaminerItemDeallocationElapsedTime>

There was heavy resource pressure at that time on Sunday morning. Quite often the standard full backup, the weekly integrity checks and the extra full backup for the SUP refresh would all overlap and combined with the BAU activity that was running at that time would lead to high I/O and low memory. On SQL Servers which are participating in an availability group, resource pressure can sometimes lead to a lease timeout whereby the cluster service and the SQL Server service have not been able to contact each other for a certain amount of time. This will cause the replica to trasition to the resolving role temporarily and when this happens all connections will be closed.


In the absence of a recurrence of the issue, to provide more specific data., I would say that the issue was down to the memory pressure experienced by these servers every Sunday, when the database integrity checks are performed.",Database Issue,"Update 28/11/2019
As mentioned above  the standard full backup, the weekly integrity checks and the extra full backup for the SUP refresh would all overlap and combined with the BAU activity that was running at that time. I have now taken the extra SUP full backup out of the mix by creating a SUP refresh job that relies on the existing full backups. Since then I have seen no recurrence of the issue.



Have changed the Sup refresh process to use existing backups to use exiting files father than take new backups. Have also upped the number of retries on the integrity checks job. Everything is much more stable now.
No incidents have occurred for some time now. Have confirmation from APO that we can close.

As a permanent solution, ESM team needs to check with DBA where the bottleneck is and accordingly fix the issue. This issue has started occurring regularly now.

","Oracle have confirmed (SR 3-20974069101) that the cause of the server restart was a Linux protection mechanism, see below :

""
I've been investigating on information captured by logs and could identify cause of the crash. 
 Behavior is documented in notes below. 

 Cause 
 =============== 
 Issue is similar to the issue described in below note: 
 OOM Killed DBWR, Causing Instance Termination ( Doc ID 1622379.1 ) 

 OOM killer, is a Linux feature that is enabled by default. It is a self protection mechanism employed by the Linux kernel when under severe memory pressure. 

 The general Solution: is to add more RAM / swap to server to avoid this issue. 

 Kindly go through below note that talks about this feature. 
 Linux: Out-of-Memory (OOM) Killer ( Doc ID 452000.1 ) 

 Solutions you can take into consideration 
 =============== 
 1. Increase the amount of physical RAM inside the server. 

 2. Add swap space if that is not in use (not the best solution!). 

 3. Turn off the OOM killer in the sysctl configuration. 

 4. If you want OOM functionality, but don't want it to affect Oracle engine, then engage your sysadmins to configure it accordingly 

 5. If the server is not dedicated to Oracle database, look at moving other services off the machine to other areas. 

 6. Monitor the memory usage in /proc/meminfo, free, and /proc/buddy to make sure that memory is being used effectively. 

 7. Watch to see if there are any memory leaks happening in any of the software currently on the system.

"Created Problem Records for Selected Services, Total 1865",7447,Planned into Release,Print and Distribution Services,SCALE,3,Cambridge English CSD ,26/09/2019 11:37:55,,SCALE Production - Interface Up Shipments,"Good Afternoon BTS Service Desk

We have noted that the time taken for SCALE production to create the xml interface files for confirmation of shipping to SAP to taking an excessive time to complete (scheduled job for this task shown below).

The volume of SAP shipments being processed has increased considerably this session and we are finding that once a SCALE shipping load has been confirmed the scheduled job is taking a number of hours to complete.

This is now having an operational impact as SAP needs to reflect the despatch status of shipments, which if SCALE takes a number of hours to produce these files will be out of sync.

An example yesterday (12 June) various shipping loads were confirmed around 18.30 (containing 1000+ shipments) , the xml files have been produced at 14.18 on the 13th June, it has taken almost 20 hours.

I appreciate these are large volumes but that is what the warehouse is now processing and volumes will only rise in the future.

One additional item to mention is that Manhattan previously delivered a fix for this interface to address the problem of it timing out and not completing the task. This was a serious issue as it could not be retriggered and shipments in SAP had to be updated manually. Since the fix was applied this interface has been 100% reliable and not missed a beat, producing all the xml files successfully.

Although we want this to run faster the execution must maintain the 100% reliability.

Please can we forward this to Manhattan for investigation.

Thanks

Iain

I've been trying to run simulations in Metrica and have run into an issue with candidates appearing to have two sets of test responses in PRD, (UAT seems fine) and therefore 2 sets of results.  This doesn't appear to be happening to every candidate in the analysis however.  (see simulations 372 and 373) and the right amount of candidates are present in the simulation.

This doesn't appear to be an issue when I last ran simulations in July but recently it has appeared (I don't know if this is connected to the fact we've had a Metrica release in that time).

I have a number of simulations I need to run for new test development purposes, so would appreciate if you could look into why this happening and if it could be fixed quickly?

The SP then internally calls SAP_PRD_INTERFACE.ADD_ASV procedure to insert new data.

SAP_PRD_INTERFACE.ADD_ASV then checks if the scholarship indicator has been set or not using the function SCHOLARSHIP_QUERY.SCHOLARSHIP_IND. If this function returns no value (i.e. NULL) then SAP_PRD_INTERFACE.ADD_ASV creates an assessment version by calling ASS_MAINT.CREATE_ASSESSMENT_VERSION. This populates the required columns in ASSESSMENT_VERS table and the push from SAP is successful.

But, when SCHOLARSHIP_QUERY.SCHOLARSHIP_IND returns a value (for a scholarship assessment), SAP_PRD_INTERFACE.ADD_ASV calls SCHOLARSHIP_MAINT.ADD_ASSESSMENT_VERSION. This is where it fails to populate the required columns in ASSESSMENT_VERS and the push from SAP fails.

The issue can be rectified by re-pushing the data in the form of an Update which is initiated by SAP_PRD_INTERFACE.AMEND_ASV which then calls ASS_MAINT.AMEND_ASSESSMENT_VERSION that runs an update statement and populates the required columns with correct values.

Some of these auto-populated fields are critical considerations when
constructing test forms, and not being able to view/access this information in
list view or exports adds hours of work for staff for each test form compiled.<br>
Additionally, we intend to incorporate automatized test form compilation into
our BAU processes, which will require that this information is accessible as
metadata for all current items.<br>

<br>
Browser(s) affected: all<br>
<br>
Metrica version: CAMLARelease version 19.2.0.12217<br>
<br>
Steps to reproduce:<br>
<br>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Login as Assessment Staff user<br>
<br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigate to Items<br>
<br>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clear filter/ensure that Pre-determined
filter is set to: Current items and Tests<br>
<br>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make auto-populated columns, such as
Answer Key &amp; Interaction Count, visible<br>
<br>
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Page through Items list view and observe
results<br>
<br>
Expected outcome:<br>
Auto-populated fields should display for all items to which the fields are
relevant. For example, Answer Key should display for all multiple choice items,
and Interaction Count should display for all items with multiple interactions.<br>
<br>
Actual outcome:<br>
Auto-populated fields such as Answer Key and Interaction Count are blank for
many items, including many items for which the fields should display.<br>
<br>
Workaround (not at all feasible):<br>
We are aware that these fields can be populated for an item by opening it,
clicking Edit, and clicking Save, but it is not feasible to do this manually
for more than 15,000 items.<br>

I have had two centres contact me today to say that they can't upload work to Repository and it gives them an error message.

I have tried manually myself with still no luck. Either uploading a candidate folder or single piece of work with the correct naming convention or a random file within the admin tab. No files have been uploaded successfully across 4 centres. Can this please be investigated.

In Metrica test delivery there appears to be an issue for Speaking and Listening tests when using Chrome as a browser.

If a user adjusts the volume using my headset device during the period when any sound file is playing, either in the mic test or in-test itself, it pauses the recording and allows the user  to restart it whenever they want. Please see the attached video.

I can't replicate this on my machine (windows 7, latest Chrome version 78.0.3904.70) and neither can other colleagues on windows 7 but it has been see on a colleagues machine (windows 10, latest Chrome version 78.0.3904.70)

The URL for the test in the video is https://www.metritests.com/metricatestdelivery/Assessment/Assignment?test=SPEAKINGDEMO%20 it can also be seen in speaking tests and the listening section of the reading and listening test.

Please could you look into why this is occurring, is it linked to the operating system maybe? Is there anything that we can do to stop this happening?

Thank you

Best Regards
Becca

Here a few framework level tasks are getting stuck while updating the database, thus causing the primary process to halt.  
As it can be seen that these tasks have started as they have create_time and start_time but have not finished as there are no end_time, thus causing the main job to hang. We also cannot confirm the exact error due to which the task got stuck as there is also no exit_code or exit_message.
There are few data tables in TC_PRD schema, which are entirely used by the spring-boot framework to store metadata related to the framework execution. As time goes the amount of data in these tables are continually increasing, and thus, these jobs sometimes get hanged while trying to access these tables. Hence as time goes size of these tables are growing and so are the frequency of occurrence of this issue.
A scheduled purge job to terminate the old framework metadata would help us to clear the DB tables and thus decrease the chances of such conflict.

Relevant dataset removed from STS end to allow SAP to re-push failed data.,"RCA: The team agrees that the root cause for the bulk of the issues is duplicate records from SAP to STS.  This may be related to the SAP retry logic combined with connection issues.  But the main point being that this issue is a result of SAP sending STS the same file with the same content and idoc.  For the remainder of the issues, this is covered by the SAP CR9000905, which has been raised as a high priority CR.

Key Actions:

• Service Protection - interim preventive measures :
o A SAP to STS reconciliation process and report will be in place on Monday, Nov 11, 2019.   Although this is an interim measure, it is still a fairly robust solution that will protect our service for now.  Stakeholders, including SAP and STS managers, will be on this report for at least two weeks build confidence in the process.

• Service protection - permanent preventive measures:
o The JAVA support team will automate the reconciliation report.  This will become part of the standard health checks.  Forever (or as long as STS and SAP exist).
o The SAP team will progress CR9000905.
o The JAVA support team will create a PR, recommend it be prioritised, and STS Application management will push to get this prioritised in the next JAVA development sprint.
",Process Failure,"STS needs to implement better exception handling to handle duplicates.  If the same file and data comes from SAP, do not identify ALL of them as duplicates and do nothing resulting in missing records.  Instead at least process one of them.

Urgent Metrica Issue.

For the 19.4 release, functionality was added to allow candidates to see their own results in Metrica.

For Linguaskill sessions where Results have been enabled for candidates, there is an issue whereby if a candidate has completed the test using an Entry Code, they get an error when trying to view their results.

Results tab shows the preview of their results:

(This is one I set up in GB599, but centres have also reported this issue)

​ [cid:image001.png@01D5957E.F400AAC0]
However, clicking ""View your Results Reports"" gives this each time:

[cid:image002.png@01D5957E.F400AAC0]
​
This only happens for cases where they've only used an Entry Code to access the test.

If they've user a Username/Password to login, they can then see their results.

Please can you investigate urgently, as Entry Codes are a very common way of accessing the test so we are expecting a lot of customer contact about this.

1.  Stop all services running on your SAS Middle Tier server
 
2.  On your SAS Compute Server, stop the SAS Cache Locator process
 
3.  Modify D:<SAS-Config-Dir>\Lev3\Web\gemfire\instances\ins_41415\wrapper.conf on your SAS Compute Server to include the following additional parameters;
java.additional.x=-Dgemfire.conserve-sockets=false
java.additional.x=-Dgemfire.member-timeout=60000
 
*where x is a sequential number, continuing on from the existing JVM parameters.  I have attached an example of wrapper.conf which shows the additional options on lines 63 and 64 for reference.
 
4. Start the SAS Cache Locator process on your SAS Compute Server
 
5. Modify D:<SAS-Config-Dir>\Lev3\Web\gemfire\instances\ins_41415\wrapper.conf on your SAS Middle Tier server to include the same additional parameters as above.  Again ensuring that x is the next sequential number.
 
6. Modify D:<SAS-Config-Dir>\Lev3\Web\gemfire\instances\ins_41415\wrapper.conf on your Middle Tier Server, this time adding only the -Dgemfire.member-timeout=60000 option (the conserve-sockets option should already be in this file).
 
7. a. Finally repeat step 6 for each Web Application Server instance that is configured on your SAS Middle Tier server (SASServer2_1, SASServer12_1 etc.).
    b. set: -Dgemfire.member-timeout=30000
    c. I can see Dgemfire.conserve-sockets=false is already set, please double check this.

Good day.

Centre: NG601

Time: 9:00AM

Issue 1:
The token of a candidate is not working: TFPMP-BW5HN
I have tried to use the token and it is unresponsive - when you enter it on the log in page, nothing happens. Can you please check?

Issue 2:
The centre cannot start the Speaking session. Error received:

""Session Details
You will be able to take the test from 08 November 2019 at 09:00""

I have checked the time zone, and everything is ok on the centre's end. It is 9:30am from the centre's location and they should be able to start the test.

We tried to adjust the test time to 7:00AM and it work. Can you explain what happened?

This issue will be affecting all Linguaskill centres so is urgent.


Linguaskill Speaking can only be created 2+ days (exactly 48 hours) before the Start time, and the session should last exactly 48 hours.

However, it is currently allowing sessions to be created 1 day before the start time, and they're only lasting 24 hours.

the short version is that a bug was introduced by EPC in February 2019, went
into PP2 on June 21, 2019 (RFC 35726) and then production July 19, 2019 (RFC
35923).&nbsp; &nbsp;Specifically: multi-page forms with single image errors
resulting in unclassified statuses requiring operator intervention are at risk
of triggering this bug, leading to a page linking issues for the affected
record as well as subsequent records in that batch.</font></font></font></p><font color=""#000000"" size=""3"">

</font><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt 72pt;""><i><span style=""line-height: 105%; font-size: 8pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">Long version of RCA from EPC:&nbsp; “So what I can see is
that we created a build in February this year that had the bug…&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;TeleForm has an entry point at which we can run our code.&nbsp; This code
includes many validations and checks (e.g. checking absent isn’t ticked if
there are responses etc.) but also the assignment of the Scan ID that comes
from your Postscan system to the images, which TeleForm then used as a page
link value to ensure the pages are linked together correctly.&nbsp; The logic
being that all pages from a multi-page form will have the same Scan ID.</font></span></i></p><font color=""#000000"" size=""3"">

</font><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt 72pt;""><i><span style=""line-height: 105%; font-size: 8pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">Another detail of the way TeleForm works is that there is a
EvaluateBegin entry point that runs upon every image going through the system
and we can use this to run our checks. &nbsp;But the problem is, for multi-page
forms, we cant run our code on every page as some checks may require all pages
to be present to work (like the absent check, which checks all fields across
all pages).&nbsp; So for this there is a PagesLinked entry point which runs
once all pages have been evaluated and linked.&nbsp; But this only applies to
multi-page forms and won’t run for single page forms.&nbsp; So, we have to run
our checks for single page forms at EvaluateBegin but only when the page-count
is 1 and again at PagesLinked for forms where the page-count is &gt; 1.&nbsp;
We can’t just blindly run it in both places as this would be inefficient and it

marked as absent.&nbsp; This is because if a form is completely blank and not
absent (which is an unusual case, only occurring when a candidate is present but
for whatever reason doesn’t attempt to answer a single question!) the
verification team can press the F5 hot-key to clear the form and save it in one
key-press.&nbsp; The system was designed such that if this option is used, as
the audit-trail for this form confirms it was, the absent field is explicitly
set to false (i.e. ‘0’) rather than leaving it blank as with a normal
non-absent form or ‘1’ for an absent form.&nbsp; It appears that Documentum
interprets the existence of any value at all for absent as an absent, so these
forms will have been interpreted by Documentum as absent.&nbsp; The good news
is that this wouldn’t have effected marks at all, as the marks would be zero in
either event, it just triggered as an anomaly when the data was being searched
for other potential absent errors.”</p></li></ul><font color=""#000000"" size=""3"">



</font>",The issue has been permanently fixed already.,"2/ Root Cause Analysis: the short version is that a bug was introduced by EPC in February 2019, went into PP2 on June 21, 2019 (RFC 35726) and then production July 19, 2019 (RFC 35923).   Specifically: multi-page forms with single image errors resulting in unclassified statuses requiring operator intervention are at risk of triggering this bug, leading to a page linking issues for the affected record as well as subsequent records in that batch.
Long version of RCA from EPC:  “So what I can see is that we created a build in February this year that had the bug…    TeleForm has an entry point at which we can run our code.  This code includes many validations and checks (e.g. checking absent isn’t ticked if there are responses etc.) but also the assignment of the Scan ID that comes from your Postscan system to the images, which TeleForm then used as a page link value to ensure the pages are linked together correctly.  The logic being that all pages from a multi-page form will have the same Scan ID.
Another detail of the way TeleForm works is that there is a EvaluateBegin entry point that runs upon every image going through the system and we can use this to run our checks.  But the problem is, for multi-page forms, we cant run our code on every page as some checks may require all pages to be present to work (like the absent check, which checks all fields across all pages).  So for this there is a PagesLinked entry point which runs once all pages have been evaluated and linked.  But this only applies to multi-page forms and won’t run for single page forms.  So, we have to run our checks for single page forms at EvaluateBegin but only when the page-count is 1 and again at PagesLinked for forms where the page-count is > 1.  We can’t just blindly run it in both places as this would be inefficient and it would error on a page 2 if we referenced a field (like the Absent tick box) which is on page 1.
The breaking change was to move all our checks in to a single module, which then gets called in either one of these conditions.  This saved having more or less the same code all written out twice, in each entry point.  But the problem was, the code that sets the page link was included in this optimisation and where a two-page form came through, but only had one image (because the other was unable to read due to the candidate scribbling over the ID barcode) the page link value was never assigned to the images so it fell through a crack!”
",Third Party/External issue,"This was fixed, tested, and the issue permanently fixed in production on November 20, 2019 via emergency RFC 38441.   The associated non-conformant candidates associated with the initial incident were addressed in our production systems by Nov 28, 2019, however an investigation and clean-up exercise to go through ALL the batches that may have been impacted was initiated.",Other

I have been updating the text in an email template in Metrica Live QA and have an issue with a dynamic field.

The resource key is ExaminerRevokeCertificationEmailBody

I have added the dynamic field {product.name} to the text but this does not pull through when the email is sent.

The html is:

This field {product.name} is used in other email templates with no problems e.g.

Please could you look into why this doesn't work in this particular email body resource field. Is there an alternate that we should use?

As per the SR with Oracle, We are hitting a bug most likely. Please see the following technical details.

• High waits on cursor: mutex X after upgrading the database to 12.1.0.2, 12.2.0.1, 18c or 19c.
• CPU utilization spikes to 100% due to the mutex waits leading to database hang or application outage.
• Huge version count is seen for the SQL statements during the problem period.
• Login or connection storm is observed during the problem.
• Huge sleeps on functions kkscsAddChildNode & kkscsPruneChild as per 'Mutex Sleep Summary' from AWR report.
CHANGES
 Upgrading the database to 12c and higher.
CAUSE
This is due to below internal bug which is fixed in 20.1.
Unpublished Bug 28889389 : HIGH WAITS ON CURSOR: MUTEX X AFTER UPGRADE TO 12.1.0.2
This bug is hit after having observed that multiple unique sessions are waiting for a parent cursor mutex in exclusive mode on the same cursor under the following stack:-
ksfwaitctx()+28<-kgxWait()+1164<-kgxExclusive()+652<-kkscsAddChildNode()
'cursor: mutex X' would have been taken on the parent cursor to find out the matching child cursor for that particular SQL. Some kind of logon storm where all sessions are executing the same cursor at the same time leading to this mutex contention. The child cursor sharing code has been optimized to reduce the Mutex Contention so that exclusive mutex is not acquired for searching the child cursors for match under the same parent.

",Software Issue,"SOLUTION
To Apply the Patch 28889389 which has the optimized code for cursor mutex while searching the parent cursor for the match.

Thanks Caroline
This confirms that this is an issue
You can however move forward and work
I don't think this will cause any further issues

However, I am planning to fix this issue
I will raise a problem for this and will let you know once this is fixed and ready for test

Hi Sharon

I've looked in OPRD EPS Timetables and I also get this error message which has never shown before - so yes, it is an unexpected error. However, once clicking on OK you are still able to see the usual screens but, as yet, I haven't tried to input any new data to see if the error message has had any impact on that functionality.
