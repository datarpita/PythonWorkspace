This loan is for working capital for a whiskey bar and music venue. We feature drinks and cocktails that hearken back to the Prohibition and Big Band eras, in a return to the elegance of that time. We are the only bar in several towns with a full-size music stage, and we feature at least one band every weekend (mostly blues, bluegrass and rockabilly, although we have had other styles in). We would like to expand into having bands every Friday and Saturday night, as well as an open mic during the week. The owner has experience running a tavern, and he has tons of great ideas for expansion. In addition, he has created jobs for eight other people by starting this business, to say nothing of supporting local bands. The business is up and running, but we are in need of working capital for things like advertising and paying for bands. It is a classy place, and we're already starting to make a name for ourself in our town. We're doing our part to revitalize our downtown area. The owner is already a member of the Chamber of Commerce, and we participate in city chamber events. I have been at my job for over fourteen years, so our ability to repay is secure. We just need some capital to really get things up off the ground.

Also, we are paying a higher monthly amount on a car loan. By consolidating the car loan with the home improvement loan, we are aiming at having just one lower, comfortable monthly payment for both things.<br><br>I've been at my current employer's  for over 15 years. Since we've been advised to do the remodels to the home before we move in, we are still in our rental. In the area of expenses, I'm currently paying $1,250 in rent (last rent payment will be in Dec. 2011) and $573 on our car loan. Our only debts are the car loan (we only have one car) and our brand new mortgage of just under $650 (principal and interest). Our first mortgage payment is due in Jan 2012. By paying off the car loan and consolidating this amount with the home improvement amount, I will only have to pay $548 for my full loan with Lending Club. This means that it will be easy for me to pay back the loan without any problems at all.<br><br>In the past, we ran into some financial problems because (1) we did not budget for expenses, (2) we had no savings set aside, and (3) we often spent more than we earned--either because of mismanagement or unforeseen expenses/emergencies. Happily, a couple of years ago, we took a personal finance managing class that equipped us with the knowledge and insight we needed to change our habit and become good money managers. Now, (1) we have a budget and we stick to it; (2) we set aside savings every month for large upcoming expenses and for emergency deductibles; and (3) we don't buy much on credit at all, and when we do, we pay off any credit card statement balances by due date.<br><br>I will be happy to answer any other questions you may have. Thank you for your consideration and  support. Your help  is much appreciated.

The interest on the outstanding balance is currently 0%, but will increase to 18.99% next month. The proposed loan will have a more favorable pricing structure.  A majority of my revolving and some installment debt is the result of a large tax liability (capital gains). My financial advisor urged me to pull from all of my personal resources in order to pay the liability as soon as possible, so I used my savings (except for emergency fund) and some debt to pay the liability in full. One of my installment loans is related to an executive graduate program. My former employer paid for the tuition and related expenses, subject to me remaining with the organization for 2 years after graduation. If I were to leave prior to that time a pro-rated balance of the tuition was to be converted into a note payable. I accepted a new position prior to the two year period, and the balance was converted to a note. My current employer reimburses me for both the monthly payment on the note (approximately $472), and the remaining expenses associated with the executive degree. I am currently in the process of paying off all debt, which should be accomplished by the 1st quarter of 2013. I will continue to pay down the higher interest facilities, and then roll the amount I was paying on an obligation once it has been paid off to the next obligation (snowball effect). My monthly budget provides sufficient excess funds from which Im able to pay debt at accelerated rate. I have been in the finance industry for 12+ years, focusing on senior secured lending, leveraged transactions, workout and restructure, and more recently consultation on M&A activity (primarily purchasing distressed assets). My unique skill set affords me a great deal of flexibility in both times of economic expansion and contraction. I have never been late on a payment, let alone defaulted on an obligation. The proposed loan will allow me to repay a significant portion of my exiting debt priced at a higher rate, and accelerate my plan to be debt free w/in the next few years.

This is a hungry market and a proven business model. Local Internet marketing is on the rise because old media techniques are less effective, while most people are now finding businesses on the Internet. Small business owners need help navigating this type of marketing because it is technical and there is a learning curve. We take care of that part and let the business owner focus on what they do best. We have been developing this business over the course of a year with assistance from three Internet marketing veterans who serve as our coaches.<br/> Borrower added on 11/05/11 > We get our customers by meeting with business owners directly and  building rapport as we discuss the needs and concerns of the owner. We don't wait for people to find us, we go to them. However, we don't try to sell anything. There are no hard sales tactics. We simply build a relationship based on mutual interests and a desire to help where we can. It is only after this initial phase that we offer to do the work that piqued their interest the most.<br/> Borrower added on 11/09/11 > Another important part if our business is working with local businesses to integrate social media into their marketing. B2B companies must utilize LinkedIn, for instance. Facebook is more appropriate for business to customer relationships. In addition, there is YouTube, Twitter, and GooglePlus. We help define up the best strategy for the particular company. We then set up the necessary accounts and teach our clients how to use their social media accounts. Alternately, we will manage these accounts on behalf of the company. Participating in Social Media can be time-consuming, but it is also crucial. Thus, we offer to manage a company's social media profiles. <br>",small_business,Small Business,160xx,PA,8.37,2,Sep-95,1,8,,5,0,14821,67.70%,20,f,0,0,18008.22,17985.87,10095.07,6501.21,0,1411.94,14.1194,14-May,65.93,14-Sep,INDIVIDUAL,0,0-10 years

I am a Federal Employee (22 years) and have incredibly strong job security, which is rare in these days.  I track all my expenses in Quicken, know my budget and always stay within my means.  I use credit cards only for online purchases, flights, or major purchases.  Unfortunately, I have had to make several major purchases over the past year.  I did not have fix rate credit cards, and with today's economy, many of them increased my interest rate by as much as 13%.  Also, as far as being responsible, I keep to a tight budget, and use Quicken to track my expenses so I can work out averages and budget my expenses.  I do not spend more than I can afford to pay, and when I do have to apply for loans it usually is only for a better &quot;financial strategy&quot; to obtain a lower interest rate.

I was not careless with my credit cards, but used them when I was out of work to pay the bills like mortgage, car, etc.  Before that happened, I had a few credit cards that had large balances on them due to unexpected travel expenses and medical expenses.  I was paying them down without a problem, but since I was out of work and had to use the others, it has become more and more difficult. Due to the large balances on the cards, the credit card companies have raised their fees and interest to a point where none of my payment is applied to the balances, just the fees.  If my payments had been applied to the balances, I would not be in such a desperate situation today.  <br/><br/>My salary should be enough to support my family and give them what they need.  It&rsquo;s extremely frustrating when most of my paycheck goes to the credit card companies each month and not even the balances.  I am a hard worker.  I have only been able to do patchwork repairs on our  house instead of large repairs that need to be done.  I need a large loan to wipe out this debt that I am drowning in plus have some extra to put into savings as a cushion for emergency medical expenses or repair bills, then I can build on that.  <br/><br/>I am extremely frustrated with my situation and have tried to get bank loans but have been condescendingly turned down due to the amount of debt.  One person even asked me why would anyone give me a loan to replace one debt with another.  I work 6 days a week.  My family sees how hard I work, and I know they sense how disappointed I am at times.  I want to set an example.  I don&rsquo;t want them to grow up thinking that all your hard work still doesn&rsquo;t get you ahead.  I don&rsquo;t want them to grow up thinking that if you are in a bind, nobody will help you.  They have continued to raise their percentage and fees and now minimum payments to the point that I am no longer able to make the minimum payments. I need help.  This loan would help my family from drowning in debt and get us back on our feet.  I would love to be able to have this hold on me gone.

I didn't care how much I spent or where it came from or went to. I also used to &quot;hook&quot; people up all the time with nothing to show for it except more debt. I've since grown up and learned much about managing one's personal finances. I need to clean up my act and get things under control. I strongly prefer not to negotiate with my lenders / banks to bring my debt load down because A, I can afford to pay it off in full and honor my commitments. And B, I've never made a late payment. As far as my repayment record goes, I'm spotless. I also usually try to pay a little extra each month but with this much debt and the big minimum payments, that was becoming increasingly more difficult. I don't want this stain on my credit history.

My income was slightly lower at the time so I couldn't get the full amount needed to consolidate.  My income is better now and since Citi Bank and GE Money Bank raised my interest rate on my 2 remaining credit cards (only 2 with balances that revolve), I'd like to just &quot;wrap those up&quot; with the current Lending Club  loan I have (which I pay on time with no problem every month). <br/><br/>My FICO:<br/><br/>Experian - 786 (per Wells Fargo internal)<br/>Equifax - 792 (per www.myfico.com)<br/>Transunion - 791 (per www.myfico.com)<br/><br/>Breakdown:<br/><br/>$18,000 total<br/>(10,511 to pay off/refi Lending Club)<br/>(4800 to pay Citi) - Charging me 18.99% interest.  They &quot;kindly&quot; lowered it from 26.99%. How nice. <br/>(1700 to pay GE Money Bank) - Interest rate is 23.99%. <br/><br/><br/>Why 60 month term? <br/>-Flexibility is key.  I'm in the financial service industry and nothing is ever certain as you can imagine.  As much as I'd love to go 36 months at a lower rate, I'd feel safer doing a 60 month term just in case.  I have enough in reserves to cover a $400 payment for this loan for 12 months along with fixed expenses.  <br/><br/>Why didn't I ask for the 18k the first time?<br/>-Great question. To be honest, I was a little naive and just assumed I wouldn't get approved.  I also wasn't sure how Lending Club worked and was tentative to &quot;put all my eggs in one basket&quot; so to speak.  In hindsight, it wasn't the smartest decision as I've ended up paying more in interest due to my tentativeness.  Now I'm ready to wipe all of these credit cards off! <br/><br/>Is my job safe?<br/>- Wells Fargo has been around since 1852. I am doing very well here and out of all the banks, Wells Fargo seems to be the most stable in terms of job security.  <br/><br/>Why Should You Invest In Me?<br/>- Because I'm essentially a guaranteed return.  I have funds in reserves to cover me should anything happen to my job.  I have a low debt to income ratio (20-26%).  I have no mortgage or rent.  I have inclining income, stable job, AND residence.  Last and certainly not least, I have perfect pay history with all lenders, MOST IMPORTANTLY, with Lending Club.  I have never been late on any payments on any debt...ever.  <br/><br/>More questions?

I just celebrated my 30 year anniversary at work on April 1st.  For 29 of the 30 years I have been employed, I have worked 50-70 hours/week.  Paying off ALL these credit cards and closing all but one with a minimum balance of $750 would give me even more money to put away. I am paying 29% on most credit cards.  This would reduce my monthly bills by half.  I have good credit, just too much that overwhelms me at times.  Consolidating my debt would also give me four bills per month to pay: mortgage, this loan, truck loan and of course the dreaded school loan!!!  Thank you for reviewing my application and for trusting me 100% to pay you back.  I will not let you down!!! Borrower added on 08/25/11 > Thank you all for trusting me!!!!

As a response to this legislation, the interest rates on many of my cards skyrocketed, even though I have never been late on a payment and have always paid more than minimum.  This event made making real debt reduction even more difficult.<br/><br/>Securing this credit card consolidation loan will be a concrete step forward in improving my financial situation, as I will use it to pay off the credit cards that &quot;adjusted&quot; to the higher rates in 2009.  As a result, my outlook will greatly improve in at least three ways: 1) The interest rate reduction will result in greater monthly positive cash flow to service the remainder of my debts and 2) The transition of revolving credit to non-revolving will improve my credit score, which will allow me to 3) seek interest rate reductions on my other credit cards.  Even if #3 is unsuccesful, the positive impact of the other noted effects are too good to ignore at this time.<br/><br/>As far as my employment outlook, I have been with my current employer for the past 2 1/2 years, during which time I have been promoted once and have been told that I will be again this year.  I have strategically positioned myself in the company as a critical asset to several high-profile projects, which greatly reduces the prospect for lay-off, even in the current economic/political climate.  However, given the worst case scenario of job loss, my prospects for securing replacement employment are almost guaranteed, given my experience in the defense industry, my skill set, the location in which I live, and my security clearance.<br/><br/>My current monthly debt obligations, outside of the balances that would be paid off with this loan's proceeds, are:<br/>$2294 - Mortgage<br/>$750 - Credit cards<br/>$394 - Student loan<br/>$258 - Auto loan<br/><br/>Please note that there were significant contributing factors to my accrual of this revolving debt; but unfortunately I have been informed that I cannot include these in my loan description, as they may give hints to information that is disallowed by law in loan considerations.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration in funding this request.<br/>",credit_card,Credit Card Consolidation Loan,211xx,MD,18.84,0,Sep-93,0,,,13,0,43213,83.70%,22,f,1347.43,1323.6,19238.26,18894.29,12652.57,6585.69,0,0,0,16-May,344.11,16-May,INDIVIDUAL,0,0-10 years

The reason for my request is twofold: (1) I am one payment away from paying the balance of two short-term debts. The monthly payments on these debts are more than the monthly payments needed to service the monthly payments for the requested loan. As the sole co-signer for a college loan for I am responsible for a past due balance on one of two loans which requires ongoing payments although my son is still enrolled as a full time student. The loan I am requesting will be used to cover the delinquency on the loan which is over 120 days past due. <br/><br/>(2) The only delinquency on my credit profile is related to this past due payments on the loan and has had a negative impact on my credit rating. When many of my creditors (particularly the banks) lowered my overall available credit (in one case by as high as 90%) to levels close to my overall balances my credit rating was negatively impacted. This put my overall balances closer to my overall credit limits although I did not incur any additional debt. With just this, one-change creditors drastically affected the credit profile of many consumers who were otherwise in good standing. I will use the balance of the loan to cover outstanding medical bills not covered by my medical and dental insurance.<br/>",debt_consolidation,Debt Consolidation Loan,070xx,NJ,13,0,Oct-96,0,,,6,0,2832,34.50%,23,f,0,0,3414.45,3176.16,2361.13,584.34,14.89563004,454.09,64.8324,13-Oct,117.92,14-Feb,INDIVIDUAL,0,10+ years

Additionally after having the AC/Heat pump and Water Heater checked, I am upgrading now as to take advantage of the tax credits, gov't rebates, and power company rebates and going to be able to save an average of $135 on my monthly power bill.  So by combining all of this into one loan I will save about $328 per month and be able to add even more into my savings every month.<br/><br/>Thanks again for your help in funding my loan quickly!

As an active duty military member, I have been deployed for 8 of the last 10 years, and found it difficult to achieve the financial security I was hoping.  While I do have college savings and a home, I would rather not tap into those secure investments to pay off my credit cards.  Instead, this loan will allow me to pay off my credit card debt within 5 years, and at the same time allow my savings and home to continue to appreciate.  I have never defaulted on a loan, including a home loan, and I have no intention of ever defaulting on my financial obligations. That is exactly why I are hoping to pay off our revolving debt with this loan. The easy answer would be to go to a credit counseling company, but it is my obligation to pay off my debt, which is what I will do with this structured loan.  Just as I serve my country with honor, I also honor my commitments, including my financial commitments.  Thank you for your favorable consideration.<br/> Borrower added on 06/27/11 > I would like to add, that my long, positive credit history supports the fact that I honor my financial committments, having never once defaulted on a debt.

As a result, I have never been late in my five years of owning the home.  In addition, I proudly own a home in full.  So while I have collateral, I would rather not tap into these secure assets, and instead remain disciplined to pay off my credit card debt in 5 years while my assets continue to appreciate.<br/>Thank you again for the response and the favorable consideration.<br/>",debt_consolidation,consolidation,981xx,WA,16.46,1,Oct-84,2,9,,19,0,56301,71.50%,47,f,984,982.59,28791.55,28752.52,17391.01,11400.54,0,0,0,16-May,497.01,16-May,INDIVIDUAL,0,10+ years

Brick and mortar stores are closing and are being replaced by Kiosks which are much cheaper to run, yet can still bring in almost as much revenue.<br/>5. Investing in DVD Kiosks now is like investing in ATM machines in the early 80s, we are now in the ground floor stage.<br/>6. I have a degree in business, and over 7 years of sales, route sales, and inventory management experience.  All of which will help me with this endeavor.<br/>7.  Red Box kiosks have 3 revenue streams, as opposed to Red Box's one: rentals.  With a Red Box Kiosk, every time a customer rents a DVD, Blue Ray Disk, or Video Game, they are presented with the option to purchase.  Also DVD Now provides advertising space on their kiosks, which provides the kiosk owner with a steady monthly stream of income.<br/>",small_business,DVD Now Kiosk,244xx,VA,9.26,0,2-Dec,0,30,,5,0,27265,64.50%,10,f,0,0,4483.18,4469.17,2200.23,1801.94,0,481.01,5.64,12-Jun,28.16,12-Oct,INDIVIDUAL,0,0 years

During the housing boom, I took a chance with the stock market with easy 0% to 5% line of credits.  It wasn't good during this time, it was GREAT, my portfolio was looking awesome.  Then the housing collapse, the credit meltdown, and dow jones fell.  I never missed my minimum payments but I never bother to pay the credit cards balance off either.  So after 3 years, I am still alive and kicking with high balances and high mimimum payments.  I always pay my bills and don't regret going for the big money during the boom.  I finally decided to consolidate my credit cards into one bill.  I just don't want to have to worry about what those credit cards are trying to scam next with late fees, higher APRs, annual fees, etc.... to try to keep me their financial servant.  I was against it for a while due to horror stories of debt consolidation or reduction.  However, I am not looking for a write-off, I am looking for a loan without risking my house.  I have 2 roommates in a 5 bed/ 3.5 baths house that covers the mortgage &amp; utilities just fine.  My job with the government is very secure and in demand.  I can and will pay this 30K debt down.

Per my description on that loan, my plan was to refinance all my credit card debt so that I could reduce total interest and pay off more quickly.  That loan was the first half, now I am doing the second half.  Following the funding of this loan my plan is to reduce my overall open to buy by eliminating some unneeded cards. The goal here is to just refinance the debt as opposed to bringing on new debt.  My income is solid, stable and ample to make payments as I believe my profile will show.  This is primarily a move to optimize the cash that I am paying out each month and create a finite path for pay off.  Funds used to pay this loan are already being spent each month and are allocated to my monthly budget, this will just allow those budgeted dollars to work more effectively.  I have worked in the same industry for 17 years now and have had only two employers (including the current one) during that period.<br/>",credit_card,Credit Card Refinance (Part II),919xx,CA,10.02,0,Jan-91,0,,,8,0,18486,75.50%,17,f,0,0,4719.83,4719.83,2499.11,1791.27,0,429.45,4.06,13-Jan,27.55,13-May,INDIVIDUAL,0,0-10 years

This is a wonderful idea especially in today's economy.<br/> Borrower added on 03/19/11 > Ok, here is more details on what this loan will be used for....<br/><br/>I will pay off all of my current debt with the exception of my mortgage loan.  I am currently renting my home to my brother with the hopes that he will obtain financing and be able buy it eventually.  I have quite a bit of &quot;roll up&quot; funds available to pay extra on my current debt and as I said earlier, my goal is to become debt free quickly.  Before paying extra, however, I need to use the extra funds to build the emergency fund needed to cover any unexpected expenses without using credit at all.  This is the &quot;3 to 6 months of income&quot; recommended.  I have recently &quot;paid off&quot; 2 bills and have used the extra funds to begin to pay off the next one on the list.  One of my creditors recently increased my interest rate for &quot;profitability purposes&quot; which baffles me as the big banks make so much money already.  With the new consumer credit laws in effect, the banks need to find ways of keeping their income at the levels they are used to and unfortunately this is also affecting some of the smaller community banks and credit unions.  I would rather pay any interest to personal investors as opposed to a select group of stockholders who do not know my situation, goals and plan for personal growth.  Another goal is to become debt free while at the same time increasing my credit score to above 800.  Being debt free to me will mean that I can make the kinds of choices that benefit my family and my community and will enable me to spend my time focusing on worthwhile projects without worry.  If the loan is not funded fully, I will continue with my current plan to become debt free (within 3 years, if not sooner)...This loan will help create momentum and peace of mind.  Thanks so much and please do not hesitate to email me with any specific questions that you may have.  I really hope that this works out because I see the potential benefits for both borrowers and investors with this type of program.

I have been with my current company (full time) since March 2001. My wife is also employed at a local dog boarding kennel since March 2008 as the manager. Her experience in animal care began in 1996, at a local veterinary hospital where she spent the next 9 years. Her exit from this location was amicable one, as she was offered to help another doctor open his 2 new practices. This took approximately 2 years, from there she was offered yet another venture of opening the kennel of a National pet store chain. After several years of working overtime for others in order to run their business's, we decided that she could have been working this hard to open her very own place. We are grateful for all the experience she has had in the blood, sweat and tears of opening a new business but we are ready to sweat for ourselves. I have no plans to leave my current full time job anytime in the near future, and my wife will be working at her current job, up until it is no longer humanly possible after opening our own location.

Your faith will not be misplaced.  I plan to use the funds to clear away my credit card debt; which will make my current income much easier to manage.  I have no dependents, so for me, budgeting will be much easier also.  What makes a good risk is simply this:  I believe that I didn't have to chase anyone to get my loan; so no bank, investor or institution should have to chase me to get it back. The terms of my loan are very reasonable, and I'm more than willing to keep my end of the bargain.  Outside of my credit card bills, there are only my monthly recurring bills to pay(rent, cable, SDG&amp;E, etc.) and even will the loan payment thrown in, I can still manage to live within my means. I live on a fixed income, but as I have said, I have done the paper and pencil work, so I know what I'm getting myself into.  If you have any questions or anything I can clarify, please don't hesitate to place your question and I will answer to the best of my knowledge and as timely as I can.

Current interest rates range for 12.90% to 26.99%. I will also be paying off the balance of my car of $14,900.00 with a payment of $683.00. Total of all debt to be paid off is $33,900.00 at payments at $1,188.00.<br/>Payment on the new loan should be $880.00 which shows a monthly debt savings of $308.00 per month, I should be able to apply this savings towards the new loan to shorten the term from 5 years to somewhere around 3.5 to 4 years.<br/>  <br/>What makes me a good borrower? I make a decent income of about $115,000.00 per year selling new homes for a large builder in a market that&rsquo;s been down but is now on its way back. While the housing market has been soft I have not had a decree in my income and my credit has not suffered. The large part of the debt is from my ex-wife which I took to help her knowing that she would not be able to pay which could affect my credit. I have never been late making payments on any of my debts and intend to keep it that way.<br/><br/>With this new loan my budget is simple, my mortgage payment is $1,780.00 and the new loan of $880.00 totals $2,660.00. My monthly income before taxes is around $9,400.00 per month so after my monthly obligations of $2,660.00 leaves me over $6,700 for living expenses, savings and investments.

I have a lot of the money I need saved up, but I owe a bit more than I can afford this year. This is primarily because I pay my mother's rent. She lost her job about a year ago and I help her with the money I would've otherwise used to pay taxes. She's also getting older (she's 57) so I'm working on increasing how much I make this year so I can take care of her and she won't have to go back to work. Right now she's on unemployment.<br/><br/><br/>What makes me a good borrower?<br/><br/>I've always been determined and worked hard. I am self-employed simply out of hard work, God's blessing(s) and because I kept going when it felt like I wasn't getting anywhere.<br/><br/>I'm a Christian and I pay my bills on time. My credit history is good. I value good credit and I am responsible for the money I owe. I was raised with these values and have always respected the property in my care, the money I owe and I'm grateful for the help I'm given. Responsibilty is a gift and I think it's important not to abuse it.<br/><br/>What is my monthly budget?<br/><br/>I'm not sure how exactly to answer this. After paying my bills and saving out for taxes, my disposable income is around $300-400/mo.<br/><br/>How stable is my job?<br/><br/>My job is really stable. I'm self-employed so no one can fire me from my job. I've been self-employed for the last 5 years. My primary income, at the moment, comes from one website. My income comes from advertisements on my site and affiliate commissions.<br/><br/>I have several other small sites I've built that make me additional income from advertisements. I am now currently building more websites that make money through advertisements and ultimately I plan to invest in additional e-businesses that sell digital goods, etc.<br/><br/>My home-business is just one aspect of all the things I want to do with my life.<br/> Borrower added on 02/08/11 > What is my monthly income?<br/><br/>I think may be what was meant by &quot;What is my monthy budget&quot; -- so I'm answering the question as thoroughly as I can.<br/><br/>I earn between $3300-3600/mo.<br/><br/>Monthly Debts:<br/><br/>Rent: $575/mo<br/>Credit Cards: $730/mo<br/>Utilities: $200/mo<br/>Phone: $80/mo<br/>School Loan: $182/mo<br/>Mom's Rent: $440/mo<br/>Taxes: $700/mo<br/>------------<br/>Total:  $2907<br/><br/>(Remaining money is disposable income of $300+)<br/> Borrower added on 02/08/11 > Most of my credit card debt was also prior to when my business took off.

People are busy and mobile grooming allows the luxury of having someone come to you to groom your pet.  The pet is not stressed and left in a strange place all day.  There are mom and pop mobiles but the franchise offers the experience and opportunity to get up and running quickly.  They will train me and the staff.

A fair portion will go towards the ring and the rest will be spent on our trip to Hawaii.  We have been living together for the past 4 years and we both feel that it is time to tie the knot. It's either now or never.  I have stable employment working a desk job for a passenger transportation company for the past three years. I see a major promotion for me on the horizon.  She is a state-certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) and has two more semesters before she earns her RN (Registered Nurse). Her projected starting salary in her new job is double my current income.  We do in fact have the cash on hand to fund the wedding without this loan, but would rather pay the interest and not pillage our rainy-day fund.  This will be my second loan with Lending Club. I paid off my first loan a few months early. At this APR, I do not intend to repay this one prematurely.  We attempt to live as frugal as possible. Cost of living in Arizona is rather affordable.  An example of our monthly budget is as follows: 650.00 Housing (2 bedroom apartment) 200.00 Sustenance 250.00 Transportation (2 economy cars, both paid for) 100.00 Entertainment 100.00 Shopping 120.00 Commuication (mobile phones, no land-line) 100.00 Savings (contribution to our emergency fund)  This budget is split between the two of us. My portion is only 760.00. If you add this loan, that brings my budget to just shy of $900.00 per month which is quite affordable for us. That is why I am a great candidate for your investment.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask. I will respond as quickly as possible. Borrower added on 01/20/11 > It looks like this loan is going to be 100% funded.

I have a very good credit history with all on-time payments on a new auto loan, for which I was able to obtain 0% interest. I am a young IT professional with a stable job history and zero dependents, which allows me to maintain a strict budget. I adhere to a budget, which allows only $240.00 p/month of discretionary spending, $300 p/month for groceries, $675 p/month for rent/utilities, and $300 p/month for student loans and transportation and the remainder falls into a variety of savings categories. Furthermore, I utilize automatic electronic payment/deduction methods to ensure my bills are paid on time.<br/> Borrower added on 01/01/11 > Additional Information that May be Helpful to Know: <br/>The debt that I am interested in consolidating is not all listed in my credit report (one account is). The debt are personal loans by a private investor (aka family member) on their CREDIT CARDS for medical and moving expenses, etc. Their interest rate on their credits cards is high at this point due to their own credit struggles (19.99 to 29.99%) and my one retail card is also high (24.99). Therefore, I would like to consolidate these loans to allow for both increased savings and ease of payment. If I am unable to obtain full funding, I would very much consider partial funding in order to pay off the higher rate debt. I would much rather obtain a loan to pay these debts and keep savings for emergencies/cushion, than pay them off and have no emergency savings (especially given the current economic climate). <br/><br/>Below are the approximate balances on the debt I am interested in consolidating:<br/>A: 6700<br/>B: 3600<br/>C: 3700<br/>D. 634<br/>E. 2500<br/><br/>Also, of note, although my car loan is currently approximately 298 p/month.

A most recent closing of the house next door, comparable sq. ft., 3 br, 2 bath but notably less land and with 3 adjacent properties, closed october 2010 at $180K. My principal balance is $128,262.20 per statement dated 10/29/10. Monthly payments for principal, interest, taxes and insurance (piti) are $976.81. My monthly payments in '09 were $1K as the closing &quot;adjustments&quot; had not raised piti payments until Jan. 2010. Since then my monthly payments have been $1.1K, hence these otherwise incalculable (questionable) lower principal uncertainties may thus simply clarify and reinforce my credit standing. I have upgraded since arrival with a poured concrete sidewalk from driveway to existing back concrete walk and a &quot;slate style&quot; finished, curving contoured concrete patio outside the sliding glass doors, replacing that end of the original concrete walk out to the edge of the house in February. Also, a microwave oven was installed above the range this summer. <br/><br/>Negotiations with new neighbors on both sides are underway to replace the back/side fence &amp; gate for our corner with highest grade and quality available by permit.

I have been faithfully paying these credit cards on time every month ever since I opened them 4 years ago. At no fault of my own I have watched my interest rates escalate. All but one of them now have an APR of more than 21%! Earlier this year I attempted to get a credit union credit card and perform a balance transfer, however the financial representative wanted me to pay them down by $3,000.00 and for me to then apply again once I had done this. <br/><br/>I have developed the useful habit of paying bills online with automation for several years. This has helped me stay current with all of my bills and in good standing with all of my creditors.<br/><br/>I need to pay off all of these credit cards so that I can reach my other financial goals. My top financial goal, next to having zero credit card debt, is to establish an emergency fund. I also want peace of mind and to make more of my money by not putting liens on my future income. I want to control my finances and pay cash for things. I will close all of these credit cards except for one. I will not carry a balnce on this card. I will use it with merchants/servicers who only accept credit cards and this will also help me maintain a mix of different types of credit for my FICO score.<br/><br/>I currently allocate $454.00 per month in my budget towards debt repayment. If I were to get this loan, the repayment would be $359.00. I would have almost a $100.00 surplus every month from just the debt repayment allocation in my budget. This money will help me save toward my emergency fund. And with the lower interest rate on this loan, I can get out of debt sooner.<br/><br/>My job is pretty stable and we're growing. We just acquired another company in August 2010 and with the financial crisis we're in, more and more people are turning to agencies like ours for help. My director and supervisor are very pleased with my work. I enjoy giving my best both at work and in all other areas of my life.<br/><br/>I like the idea of a loan from Lending Club so that I can take control and know that I paid off my credit cards and that I paid back my loan.

I suspected as much, as I've got some broken teeth in the back of my mouth, as well as occasional infections that I've fixed over time in peace meal fashion. Due to the fact I don't have insurance, I rarely go to the dentist (a stupid decision in hindsight) But my experience on vacation gave me a wake up call that I need to get all of my issues fixed.

We have been using credit cards to finance the move and supplies and now want to consolidate everything into 1 single payment. We always pay on time and I have a full time job as well - bringing in more than enough income to cover the monthly expenses despite the success of the business. I'm pretty low risk...with a 705 FICO score as of 11/7/2010.<br/> Borrower added on 11/08/10 > This year, our home based business has generated $70K in sales...of which approximately 60% was profit due to the low overhead we have working out of the the home office. Can proviide our business plan and P+L for those truly interested in lending the money to expand. We have a steady and growing list of clients in St. Augustine, FL and have been adding many new services over the past year that are gaining traction. Again, this is as low risk for any investor as I can imagine...being that I make appx. $80K a year outside of the business, more than sufficient to pay off this loan in the allotted time. Together, our income is above $125K - give or take.<br/><br/>Our new location is in the Medical District of St. Augustine and our target market is the medical base of our community, which, if you acknowledge that health care is booming, this minimizes the risk even more!<br/><br/>We're a safe bet...<br/> Borrower added on 11/12/10 > Special thanks to those who have determined us to be a safe investment...you will not be let down!<br/><br/>As for where we are:<br/>Today, the flooring and server were installed. My husband has already sold 11 remote backup services which account for our monthly rent. Whoohoo, not debt there!<br/>As for the loan, there is still a considerable amount remaining, so I decided to let you all know what it will be used for...<br/>1. Payroll...we always paid contractors and sub-contractors, now we have staff and need to ensure that the money is in our account to do so. Currently we have 1 year of salaries in the bank...<br/>2. Credit Card payments: We have funded about 40% of the expansion using credit cards totalling less than $20K. While about $10K is no-interest credit, the other $10K is not and will be paid with the funds we are requesting.<br/>3. Our monthly debt for business is about $800 for everything - excluding salaries and new equipment. We are already prepaid on the rent 6 months out and plan to pay this way for the duration of the 5 year lease.<br/>4. There is a small amount of money going towards a leased car for the business, since we travel quite a bit. A vehicle wrap is being installed for marketing purposes...this is being done by my husband to reduce costs.<br/>We are about $13K short of our goal...please feel free to send me any questions you have...would like to close this chapter up and get moving with the &quot;making  MORE money&quot; part ASAP.<br/>",debt_consolidation,Debt Consolidation Loan,320xx,FL,8.92,0,Aug-95,1,78,,18,0,19505,56.40%,27,f,0,0,10755.71,10734.21,6282.15,3623.24,0,850.32,9.13,11-Oct,901.31,12-Mar,INDIVIDUAL,0,10+ years

This year, I paid off 2 $5,000  60 unsecured loans early,and about $4500 in credit cards.  I have a good payment history, I believe its very important to pay back the money you borrow and to not over extend yourself.  I have another account with The Lending Club,Member_357044. That loan has  helped me consolidate some of my debt as well, but I also went above and beyond consolidating and outright paid a substantial portion off this year. I have a good history of paying back on time, if not early. The only current debt I have is my car lease, the loan I have with Lending Club now, and a credit line with citi; this loan would be the only new unsecured debt for the year.I encourage you to look my other account up, you will see that in a couple of months,January I believe, that loan will be half paid off. I encourage you to see how I have made consistent, timely payments.  As an individual that has lent money before to friends and family, I am aware of the risk you're taking. And as a borrower too, I would not want to be late on my payments because I do not want my credit to deteriorate, especially in this tight credit environment, but also,it is the right thing to do.  This money will help pay for the unexpected, costly damage to my car,and keep my liquidity in tact.  I can afford to take the money out of my account, like I said I just dont want to dig into my nest egg right now.

I've been doing this for some time and I ALWAYS have sent more the the required amount to each credit card working on getting the debt down.

THANK YOU!<br/><br/>I want to make sure that it is clear that when I applied I gave my current income as my hourly wage X 40 hours per week X 52 weeks for a years income. This comes out to approx $36, 358.00. I need to tell you that I work overtime just about every week. My income so far this year is $45,673.00 for weeks up to 10/18/2010. This also does not include my wife's income. She works 9 months out of the year doing home visits with pre-head-start kids.<br/><br/>I didn't want any investors looking at my debt to income ratio and think that I'm living too tight for comfort. I am not. I've not been late with a payment to any of my creditors for at least 12 years ( may be even more ) and this loan payment will not add any further burden to my monthly output. (See explanation above.)<br/><br/>I wanted to make this clear as I'm in fear that this loan might not go to full 100% funding as the funds just seem to be &quot;trickling&quot; in. I have a long way to go in only 9 days!  I'd hate to think that you did not invest with my loan because of my reported lower earnings than what I actually am making. I reported my &quot;regular&quot; earnings, but I make more than this with my &quot;overtime&quot; earnings. I hope this further information is helpful.<br/><br/>Please ask me any questions and I'll get back to you ASAP!<br/><br/>Thank You again for your support,<br/><br/>Dave<br/>",car,Car & debt consolidation,178xx,PA,24.82,0,Sep-88,1,,,18,0,18654,28.60%,37,f,0,0,17127.48,16835.2,14277.65,2838.13,0,11.7,2.106,15-Apr,323.16,16-May,INDIVIDUAL,0,10+ years

We supply 100% recycled materials to businesses that wish to switch to becoming a green business. We work with the EPA Waste Wise Program and also get certifications for these business that use and buy our products. We supply sustainable goods that effect our Eco and waste systems. We are seeking a 25K loan for expansion as we have 6 over 400 room hotels that want our products in them and we are about to get a major airport as well. The funding is for stock and to hire 2 more sales reps, and because we are a new business our manufacturer is requiring COD for the first 1yr. of our shipments. We have been in business now for 7 months and have made a steady small profit which we put right back into the company. We have a web based sales launch planned for next March as well to bring these great products to the everyday consumer. I personally use all the products in my home. I would appreciate it if you could fund this loan as there are so many outlets for us to sell our products and make this world more green and better with the use of these products to help continue sustainability in our Eco and waste systems for the future. The bank loved our business plan but denied our loan because we were a start up, the catch 22. We have as I have said several National Hotel chains as clients, the airport deal will be done by October 1st and We as a company are growing rapidly and can sustain this loan. Our products are made from a process that is made of and from the bi products of sugar cane. We do paper products, 100% safe cleaners and everything even a restaurant can use for there take out products. I thank you for all of your investors that use this service and request that you fund our loan. Thank you.<br/><br/>We were on the website before, but removed due to a processing glitch in verifying our 4056 form. At that time all of you wonderful people had almost funded our loan request to 100%. We have reposted and ask that you continue to fund us to 100% as it was a glitch with the IRS with processing time to just verify our taxes which has been done now. Again Thank you for everyone that will be funding this loan. Also we have secured another hotel that wants to go and be GREEN in the mean time, while this processing was taking place. Thank you all again very much.<br/>Add more details to your loan description:<br/>",renewable_energy,SOLID GREEN Business needs a little help,024xx,MA,20.74,0,Oct-95,1,,,11,0,90633,98.60%,18,f,0,0,14687.91,13409.74,2729.59,2970.47,0,8987.85,817.7184,11-May,950.12,11-Aug,INDIVIDUAL,0,10+ years

I say this because a lot of people are worried about their careers, but that's not a concern for me. <br/><br/>The owner of the company has also been paying for me to go to a doctor supervised weight reduction plan, for which I have truly been blessed. He wanted me to lose weight for two reasons - one was that he wanted to make sure that I was around for my two girls for a long time, and that he really wants to make sure that I am with him for the long run - which will be 10 years in October. This week I have been on the plan for 15 weeks and have lost 102 lbs. This is something that I have commited to.

My bring home pay each month, including child support, is $3200. Currently, I have $20 taken from each pay check and put into a saving's account and my bank also offers a saving's system which transfers $1 from your checking into saving's for every transaction. In a typical month I can save about $120 between the paycheck deductions and the transaction transfers. <br/>My approximate balances and APRs for credit cards are:<br/>$923  - 29.9%<br/>$2510- 27.9%<br/>$1825- 29.9%<br/>$2081- 26.9%<br/>$1371- 24.9%<br/>$954-   19.1%<br/>$619-    9.9%<br/>$1864- 0% for one year<br/>Unfortunately, a few of these credit card debts ($1864- 0%, and the $1825-29.9%) arose from having a pet with a serious medical condition who died after the $1864 stay at the animal hospital. The rest of the debt was more bearable prior to the last 6 months of medical problems with the dog. <br/>In the last year, I paid off 2 other credit cards and have not used them since then, I didn't close out the accounts because I was told it looks bad on your credit report, so they are just not in use. The rest of this debt I plan on paying off prior to the 5 year payment plan that I chose for this debt consolidation loan. <br/>I am the sole wage earner in my household as I was recently divorced and, unfortunately, the one who kept the debt. This is why it is imperative for me to find a way to reduce my monthly expenses by consolidating these high interest credit card payments. I have two children to care for and plan for their futures, with this credit card debt it is difficult for me to provide for them and save for their futures at the same time. <br/>I am only requesting 8k for the consolidation because the other debts that I owe have lower interest rates than what was offered through the initial loan application process, and I plan on paying off the interest free one when I receive my tax return. <br/>Hope I answered all of your questions!  :)<br/>",debt_consolidation,Amy's Relief,329xx,FL,20.4,0,Sep-95,2,43,,31,0,11712,78.10%,57,f,0,0,3886.97,3886.97,1598.29,2275.13,0,13.55,0,12-Mar,215.98,16-May,INDIVIDUAL,0,0-10 years

I am very committed to getting my debt eliminated as quickly as possible and therefore am working very hard at doing that.<br/> Borrower added on 08/14/10 > I would appeciate your willingness to invest in a person who will make their payments on time and be thankful for the Lending Tree and will recommend it to anyone .<br/>,debt_consolidation,Debt Consolidation,550xx,MN,8.45,0,Mar-00,1,55,111,14,1,4416,49.60%,19,f,0,0,9071.08,9071.08,4769.87,3793.06,0,508.15,38.0815,13-Jul,245.58,13-Dec,INDIVIDUAL,1,0-10 years

I&rsquo;d like to introduce myself and explain the purpose of my loan. I&rsquo;m 33 years old and have been paying bills since I was 18. I have never made a late payment on any credit card, car loan, rent, etc. I am not married nor do I have children. I have a great job at a mortgage company that is close to home and has full medical benefits. I&rsquo;ve been working there for six and a half years, the company has been in business for 28 years. You can see their website at www.mountainmortgagecorp.com.<br/><br/>I have a very small monthly budget. Rent $893, Phone and Internet $70, Electric $50, Gas $20, Car Insurance $120, Food $130, Credit Cards $150, Miscellaneous $30. This all totals $1463.<br/><br/>The purpose of my loan is to help me start a side business. I have been a computer programmer since I got out of high school and for the last few years I've been programming game engines for all the major independent gaming platforms (Xbox, Iphone, Android, Blackberry, Symbian, Windows Phone 7, Google, PC, Mac) so I can tap into the booming independent games market. My engines are complete for a number of games with place holder art. The money I wish to borrow would be used for a few different things. First to pay professional artists and musicians to add high quality art and music to the games. To purchase the proper equipment to fully test all the games on all the platforms and operating systems. To pay for professional advertising and viral marketing campaigns. And finally to add professional content to my e-commerce website which will promote/sell the games and merchandise. I'm taking this side business very seriously. This loan amount would cover everything I need to create a very professional presence and ensure quality recognition in the future. If I get this loan quickly I'll have a few of the games out before December and be able to take advantage of all the extra purchases made during the Holiday Season. I think that about covers it. But should anyone have any other questions, please feel free to ask. Thanks!<br/><br/>P.S. I read that it is better to be proactive on the Credit Review Status so I called Lending Club today and asked if there is anything I can do to speed up the process. Their representative told me there wasn't and that I just had to wait for the Credit Review team to get to my file. I hope they get to it soon.

We are DIY remodelers, no $50K kitchens here! The condo needs interior paint, flooring and more attention to the bathroom and kitchen areas to replace old fixtures.  <br/><br/>We also have need of a 2nd car and are looking to have our old reliable minivan repaired or replaced with a &quot;new to us&quot; version. In addition, I will be using these funds to pay off the balance of an old school loan of my wife's so that she can have her transcripts released for the fall in a timely fashion for the university she is attending and to soon schedule needed surgery for one of our beloved dogs.<br/><br/>As a legal permanent citizen of the U.S. (I am a Swedish citizen), I came here with no established credit history and have been working to obtain one. I'm pleased to say my credit history is Good with no delinquencies. I have two MasterCards with modest balances that will be paid down by the end of August (Orchard Bank and CapitalOne), as well as a Fingerhut account with a balance of $295.00. I have also a small personal loan from my credit union that I do not wish to pay off since it is new and I want to establish good history with that loan as well.  I feel that a second installment loan suits my diverse credit need better than applying for more credit cards with higher APRs and annual fees and will help further diversify my credit portfolio while keeping the monthly payment highly manageable. I have been exceptionally diligent about my monthly payments and my credit history should reflect this.  <br/><br/>My job is stable.  I have worked for my company for three years and have received several accolades and bonuses over that term, including an invitation to continue work at the Gillette factory when the main Sonoco packaging plant was due to close this year.  My monthly take home pay has averaged $3K per month for the last two years. I am the primary breadwinner for the family and pay the mortgage for my wife's condo. <br/><br/>My wife lost her job in 2006 and has since received a college degree and started her own freelance writing business this year.  As the business is only four months old, typical monthly income is not yet predictable, though she targets between $200 and $300 a week.<br/>",car,"Car, Home Improvement, Other Loan",030xx,NH,3.64,0,1-May,3,,,4,0,1033,86.10%,5,f,0,0,1738.49,1738.49,645.45,1078.06,14.97623671,0,0,11-Jun,195.68,16-Apr,INDIVIDUAL,0,0-10 years

My parents were no longer able to fully pay for my tuition and extra expenses out of pocket, as they had done prior to the economic downfall.  Additionally as I approached the end of my college career, I asked for less and less hours to ensure doing well in my final few classes.  Now that school isn't currently in the picture, and I'm secured in the federal employee system; I anticipate being comfortable paying the potential loan off.  Understandably, I've had skeptical lenders ask questions regarding how I would manage being timely and consistent with payments while moving out if I've been unable to manage this at home with my parents.  In my defense, again as just mentioned, this debt was primarily due to charging my tuition while working less than typical part time hours.  Secondly, I've been managing making at least my minumum payments.  Only twice, I missed my due date, as I overlooked the date and wasn't more than one day delinquent.  Therfore, I really do know I can manage rent in addition to the loan payment without accummulating aditional debt.<br/>",debt_consolidation,Get out of Debt!,945xx,CA,15.15,0,Aug-88,0,,,10,0,17518,71.30%,12,f,0,0,18786.45,18722.67,9798.72,8263.46,27.09050768,697.18,7.62,13-Jun,636.92,13-Oct,INDIVIDUAL,0,0-10 years

That was alot of info i had down about me, maybe to much.  Anyway...  <br/>   Short Version.= I am 31  and i recently became a first time buyer home owner this year.  I had some good luck, I been saving 3 years ago more than half my monthly paycheck been going to my saving account., also about year and half ago i decided to start fixing my credit, it was 561 and to this day it is at a 741.  I have to admit it was perfect timing when I picked out this brand new 3b/2b 2200 sq ft house for 120k. I been planning this out for such a long time.  I gave alot of dedication, money, and work into buying a house, and it payed off. Plus made it in time for the first time buyer tax credit.   I researched what i needed to put down: 20% and found out the closing cost was around 5k.  I been working since the middle of 2003 at our family exporting business to Latin America, With the recession happening our business kept running strong, we all notice some change but kept on moving.  Our company exports fertilizer, insecticides, and pesticides  that are biodegradable and environmentally .safe  for the farms down there.  It is a very good and stable job, people need to eat.  I been living in my new house for about 5-6 months.  I figured that the left over money i had left the buying the house would be enough to get some appliances and improve and upgrade the house.  Well i know now some appliances are up there in price and it isn't the fancy pieces. also started with hardwood flooring in areas and found out the hard way that the money went fast and most of it was for the little things u do not calculate. Everything is perfect with bills and credit cards, since they have low credit.  For some of the projects ( finishing the floors, counter top for the kitcken and fixtures cost some money.  It is very easy for me to make payments, i keep at least 3 weeks -month ahead of all my bills, the 20% down gave me a really good monthly payment rate.  With my great credit score i been pre approve for the credit cards that can help, but after picking 2 and being denied after pre approve it was more hurting me with inquires.  I find it difficult to come up with 2-3k or the full price to have it at that time for somewhat big purchase for the house, np with coming up with 1-1.5k  for a down payment and go with payment but even if i had the money to back it up like always having low credit limit and now Inquiry are adding up are preventing my chance. even with a killer credit score with a mortgage. When i looked at this site going through my credit score online seeing that the payments at 300 is perfect fit in my cycle of bills for each month.  I hope luck is on my side with this just like the house because this pretty much my last hope to get the ball moving.  I have been perfect the last 5 years no late payment nothing to get to were i am at.  I take my credit and monthly payments very seriously.  This loan can finish my sections of wood flooring. grabbing the rest of the pieces to my bed room set, kitchen counter top.  upgrading the fixtures and adding some furinture to the other bedrooms.  It is this loan which i used up a credit inquiry, or ill have to wait for how long when they want raise my credit which some already which i am happy but still low.   I apologize to anyone that has read this far.  I feel that being honest will get peoples respect and that i qualify for alot of things, there are some little numbers holding me back. <br/>Thank you for your time<br/>",credit_card,A fresh start 2010,339xx,FL,2.91,0,Sep-98,2,,,8,0,2038,37.10%,11,f,0,0,12855.79,12739.13,8180.47,3852.63,15.0978977,807.6,16.4489,14-May,37.29,14-May,INDIVIDUAL,0,0-10 years

My goal is to purchase our first home within six months and credit card utilization plays a big part in FICO scoring. An installment account is scored differently than CCs and this loan would result in a big bump in our FICO scores and thus place us in a better position to get a lower rate.<br/><br/>To summarize my credit reports, all are the same with up to a 13 year history (depending on the report) with an average age of approx 3-4 years. I don't know how much info you can see, but I have a total of 20 accounts on TransUnion with all but 5 being current and open with zero lates. The closed accounts include three closed and paid (in good standing) CCs that were closed due to higher rates and/or fees, and two car loan accounts. Both car loans are paid in full, with the latest being last spring and one followed me from a dark period in my credit history and was a redeemed repo. After the repo, I paid past due amounts and continued until paid in full and that was over 4 yrs ago. The repo occurred over 5 yrs ago with lates leading up to that. I believe there are seven 30 and 60 day lates reporting with the last being 1/2005. Other than that I have no other bad accounts reporting, including no judgments, collections, etc. <br/><br/>Per new credit, I have 8 inquiries reporting on TransUnion but all of them, except for one, are older than 1 yr old and are about to drop from the credit report. The most recent inquiry is 8-9 months old. This is my first and only attempt at a loan.<br/><br/>My monthly income is at $5,260 and I've been with the same company since May of 1997. I worked my way up and have served as president since the start of the year. We are in the commercial services industry (janitorial, security, landscaping, supply sales, etc.) since 1978 and are rebounding at $1.7M/yr, debt free, BTW. Not included in the stats are household income. My wife is a stay-at-home mom to 4 kids, but she earns income by serving on the board for our company. That income is at about $22k/yr. Aside from that, we earned an extra $5300 in reported misc. income last year. <br/><br/>Per DTI, our monthly obligations are the rent ($1000) and CC payments.<br/><br/>Per cash reserves, we have about $2000 in cash available at all times with $35k in a CD saved for our future home. We also have just over $20k in a 401(k).<br/><br/>One question I'd ask is why so much debt and why is your CC utilization so high? Over the past year, my wife didn't have (well, we didn't have) health insurance. Despite that, come 2 weeks ago, kiddo #4 came and we paid the hospital in cash. Felt great, but I used CCs as a crutch over the past many months. To compund things, I had over $8000 in credit with DSNB (Macys and Bloomies) and they made a change in CC reporting and stopped reporting the credit limits. That shot my CC utilization up by 35% overall in one day. Thankfully, I only had balances on two of the accounts, one of which recently got paid off and has yet to report. Last year, I added an Amex Green and funnelled all purchases on that card. That forces me to pay in full monthly all the while chipping away at the remaining CC balances (approx 10 of 20 accounts have balances). <br/><br/>I probably typed too much, but wanted to be thorough.<br/> Borrower added on 07/09/10 > I wanted to give an update...I called today and they had already received everything they needed.

This loan will be used to consolidate all revolving lines of credit so that there is one monthly payment.  I have been making double, sometimes triple, monthly payments on each of these lines of credit but am finding that the interest rates are making it difficult to see the balances going down.  This is the reason I am looking forward to consolidating these balances.  I will be able to pay more than the minimum and actually be able to see the balance drop.  <br/><br/>I am currently employed with the City of Lake Lotawana as Court Administrator.  Prior to moving to Missouri I was employed with the City of Prairie Grove, Arkansas for 8 years and before that I was employed by Tyson Foods, Inc for 13 years.  The only reason I left these jobs was due to relocation.  I have no plans to leave this area and, as I mentioned earlier, I plan on being married soon.  I would like to be completely debt free as soon as possible and have spoken to a financial counselor to help show us the best way to do so.  My fiancee is self employed and has been for 22 years and also has a steady income.  His name is not on this loan, but I think it's important to know how he is involved.  <br/>I would appreciate your consideration.

It badly twisted my neck, and I have been in pain and in treatment by doctors ever since.  I have followed a conservative course of treatment to avoid surgery, but when I stopped improving last year, I saw a neurosurgeon and he recommended surgery if I ever wanted the pain to go away.<br/><br/>My claim against the insurance industry is still open.  I have not settled for two reasons.  One, I haven't finished treatment, and two, they have offered to settle for only $70,000.  That sounds like a lot, but it does not cover the financial damage of eight years of medical expenses that I have had to fund out of my own pocket.<br/><br/>I have been putting together my final set of documentation to submit, but Iâve reached the end of my claim period and to keep the claim open, I must file suit.  My claim is also against my own insurance company, whom I have been with for 30 years.  In the past they have always settled claims fairly, but none of those was ever a personal injury claim.<br/><br/>I have not been, nor am I now, represented by an attorney.  I don't agree with the personal injury contingency approach to settling an accident claim.  <br/>I need one now to file suit and to provide advice on a few key issues because of the push-back Iâm getting.  I have no intention of going to court, but I do expect to go to mediation. <br/><br/>I believe the claim is worth at least $100,000 and perhaps more.  Why do I believe that now?  From the research Iâve done and because of the Neurosurgeon report that will say that the  surgery is necessary.<br/><br/>Use of funds:  To cover attorney fees, filing fees, doctor's statements and mediation.  <br/><br/>Source of Repayment:  When the claim settles.<br/><br/>I will include a copy of the last offer from the insurance company to the Lending Club folks along with income information.

That is why I am confident that this loan will be repayed within my 3 year goal period of time, if not sooner! Thank you all again for your consideration! You may be asking yourself why I would even consider doing this loan then, well the answer is: I am not going to repay Citibank with my loyalty after they triple my interest rate after having been an excellent customer for 10 years! I believe in people who do the right thing being rewarded, and they flat out refused to change their ridiculous rates. I would rather provide an interest/return for investors than for a bank who is poorly managing their customers money, and over-debting customers who may have no intention of repaying their debt.

Second, this time there was also the additional challenge of the worsening economy. Just at the time when we needed our credit the most, Bank of America pulled the rug out from under us.

In turn, this means that our services are required, and new business thus also realized.    Consequently, ours are no ""long term"" issues.

Eating at home and becoming healthier, we actually lost weight in doing so. <br/>With your assistance we can achieve a better and a more frugal lifestyle by paying off our Lending Club account in 3 years rather than 10-15 with just the minimun.  To add, we will also be able to save more money for our family and our kids future by starting a school trust.  <br/>Thank you and God Bless.<br/> Borrower added on 04/17/10 > Amounts to be applied to loan for 95%  Credit Card payoff with high interest rates.

After the initial advertising campaign, 5% of revenue will be used for advertising.<br/><br/>-Update the companyâs electronic equipment:  The electronic equipment the company uses can only be described as antiquated.  Paperwork that is currently presented to the prospective customer is hand written hard copy.  I will use 20% of investor supplied funds to purchase a field laptop, portable printer, and necessary software.  The impact on a prospective customer of a hand written proposal vs. a color, graphical electronic printout is well worth the cost.  <br/><br/>-Company Image:  I will use 20% of the investor supplied funds to update the company image.  The company does not have a website so a website will need to be developed and hosted.  Business cards, printed brochures, folders will need to be purchased also.  The company has no uniforms.  Uniforms for the crew and evaluator will give the company a more professional appearance.<br/><br/> The truck the company uses to haul the crew and heavy duty equipment is 14 years old.  It runs well but the appearance leaves much to be desired.  I will have the truck painted.  I will also have the company logo and contact information printed on the truck.  The company trailer will get the same treatment.<br/><br/>-Job materials: 20% of investor supplied funds will be set aside materials that will need to be purchased to complete the first job.<br/><br/>-The remaining investor supplied funds will be used for miscellaneous expenses that will arise during ownership transition such as legal fees.<br/><br/>I do not intend to fundamentally change the way the company does business.  The company has been in business for many years and has had success; they do quality work at a reasonable price.

It has worsened to a point that my eyes can no longer be fitted with glasses or contacs.  my only option is to have a corneal cross-linking done to stabilize the cornea, then either a lens implant or lens transplant to allow my eyes to be fitted properly.  If I do not have the procedure, then I am faced with the inconvenience of not being able to see clearly and place my career of choice for over 20 years on the line.  As a teacher, I am continuously transitioning from close vision to far away and the keratakonis keeps me from having that clarity. <br/>Unfortunately, this medical procedure is quite expensive and not covered by insurance.  Also, due to my home location, travel and lodging for re-coup time and follow up appointments almost double the cost of the operation.  I do not have that kind of expendable cash, thus am asking for assistance.  Any money received that is not needed for my surgery will be used to pay other eye doctor appointment costs that were out-of-pocket for consultation, etc. <br/>Thank you so much for any  and all assistance you can provide.

I was really not looking forward to my summer because although I have the time for the surgery and healing, I lacked the funds to see it through.  I asked the specialist in Toronto why insurance does not cover it, especially since there are no other options.  He told me that insurance will cover the equipment needed to perform the procedure, but not the surgery itself.  It is so frustrating to work so hard and ensure all monthly bills are covered, only to find out that all the insurance premiums I pay do absolutely nothing  to help me when I need it.  I also have narcolepsy and cataplexy which requires medication in order to maintain the level of seratonin necessary to get through my day.  The medications needed for this condition are very expensive and there are constant stressors from insurance there as well.  I am able to cover the meds that are not covered by the deductible/copay but I am just not able to prepared myself for something of this magnitude.  I think that this is a fantastic program for lending and someday when I am in a better place financially, I will gladly become a lender to someone who is in need like I am now.  I believe strongly in a ""pay it forward"" philosophy in all aspects, even it is just passing on a smile and/or ccompliment.

This florist specialized in funerals and weddings on top of the usual seasonal business you would expect in this industry (valentines day, mother's day, etc.). In the past few years the previous owner moved to Alabama and began to let the flower shop's operations become neglected and inconsistent. She recently closed the florist due to the complication of trying to operate the business from Alabama. <br/><br/>I plan to reopen the Florist shop in the same location because most of the larger equipment is still there, including a $10,000 walk-in cooler and display for the flowers. Having this equipment alone will make reopening the shop easier, and to add to that benefit my grandmother and her sister (who used to keep the books, and operated the business) have offered to work to get the business back to a profitable condition. They are confident that they will be able to earn back the business of all the major funeral homes in the area as well as the local courthouses and churches.<br/><br/>The Location that I have a pending contract on has little to no competition within about 10-15 miles in any direction. And is located on a high traffic volume state road, right next door to a Starbuck's coffee shop that has been very successful. <br/><br/>The landlord of the property has a good relationship with my family and has agreed to verbally commit the property to me until I am certain about the financing. He has also agreed to offer very generous concessions even though he has had two other possible florists show interest in the location.<br/><br/>Total operation costs including all expenses, labor and inventory averaged less than $5,000.

I did not have the information in front of me to properly address it at the time, and as I have no internet service at home, I needed to call and get the details pertaing the remaining revolving credit balance. One lenders asked why I only requested $19,750.00 rather than the full amount of my debt. The answer for that question is: I was only allowed to request that amount, and according to the rules I read regarding a loan with Lending Club, a loan cannot exceed $25,000.00. I took the credit bills I have that had the highest percentage rates and added them up and that is how I determined the amount I did. The rates of these cards ranged from 18.99% to 23%. By consolidating and obatining a lower rate, I felt I would achieve 1.) a lower rate, which mean't less paid out in interest in the long run and less time to pay down money owed; 2.) would enable me to take high interest cards and combine them into one manageable payment; 3.) less hardship on my family. <br/><br/>The remaining revolving credit (totaling: $18,223.98) is care credit for $5,898.36; Barclay Mastercard for 4,435.88; Chase Visa $2,168.36; Chase $5,731.38; <br/><br/>I have stated the reasons for the debt, and I have covered, I think, the questions asked.

Many private vehicles- cars, mini-buses, motorcycles, bicycles etcâ¦ have been converted into taxis. The city of Kinshasa has a population of 9,000,000 people and there is a need to move 4,000,000 people on a daily basis. In Kinshasa the average load factor on large buses at the morning peak reaches 200 percent, with passengers hanging out of the bus or even sitting on the roof.<br/><br/>The urban transportation in the province of Kinshasa is mainly provided by two government owned corporations: City Train and STUC however, their fleet is limited. City Train has a total of 86 buses with a capacity to move 100,000 people. Due to its mismanagement, STUC active fleet has been reduced to 10 buses compared to 150 when it was first created in 2006. Both City Train and STUC are only able to move 120,000 people daily. According to a study by Ajay Kumar & Fanny Barrett, âStuck in Traffic: Urban Transport in Africaâ, the void in public transportation service is filled by private vehicles which account for 1200 minibuses. <br/><br/>The average family is able to afford no more than one daily round trip on the bus, while for the poorest households even this basic level of mobility is unattainable. But even this low rate of use translates into peak demand for around 200 seats per thousand residents, about five times higher than the supply available in any of the cities sampled.( Stuck in Traffic: Urban Transport in Africa, Ajay Kumar & Fanny Barrett)<br/><br/>To solve this problem, We have decided to enter this market by purchasing used school buses in the United States and used them for urban transportation in the city of Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of Congo)<br/>I will be the General Manager in this business.<br/>",small_business,Urban Transportation,750xx,TX,8.04,0,5-Nov,1,,,7,0,14729,85.60%,8,f,0,0,18924.18,18905.26,2060.24,2802.32,61.45673653,14000.16,4902.08,10-Oct,801.27,16-May,INDIVIDUAL,0,0-10 years

We are a company that handles Comcast installations as well as Verizon construction.  My duties as HR Manager include but are not limited to - Recruiting, disciplinary actions, grants, policies and procedures, and so on.  I have been with my current job for the last 3 years and I am a shooting star in the company.  The one major item that is holding me back is the way my teeth are.  It is embarrassing to meet new people everyday with the set of teeth I have in mouth. There also is some dental work that needs to be fixed as I am in some pain.   I a also getting married 09/10/11 of next year and would like to look my best on my wedding day.  Do to poor parental guidance growing up these issues weren't taken care of then.  I am now 30 years old, making very decent money and I have no loans out there!  My monthly expenses are small as I have a roommate and we split a $900 rent payment - $450 for me.  I also own my car outright as I bought it used.  My monthly bills do not exceed $1,000.  I owe no money to any creditors and mystudent loans have all been paid.  <br/> My job is very stable, as cable and internet is one of the cheapest forms of entertainment and internet is a must in every home in america.  I also dj 3 nights a week for extra income ranging about an extra 3 grand a month.  Please consider helping me with this loan as this will help me for the rest of my life.

That should take from a week to two weeks.<br/><br/>The reason I'm requesting the loan is to be able to scale up and also leverage the rest of my budget with another major ad network that has similar offer but requires less upfront commitment.<br/><br/>If I get my Lending Club loan, I expect to either pay it in full within 90 days or take it out of Yahoo! should they or me are ultimately unsatisfied with the ROI and take it to another advertising network with which I'm currently negotiating.<br/><br/>Any questions, please feel free to inquire I'd be happy to explain further how the process works<br/><br/>Thank You for your consideration<br/> Borrower added on 12/19/09 > My only expenses:<br/><br/>-no car<br/>-$100+ minimum payment for the one credit card I use<br/>-no rent <br/>-$48 cable bill<br/>-half of $85 cell phone bill<br/>-groceries<br/>-have no other debts besides 1 credit card<br/>",small_business,Startup Working Capital,984xx,WA,2.11,0,6-Jul,1,,,7,0,4949,0%,8,f,0,0,17156.69,17071.4,12925.29,4115.29,0,116.11,2.73,12-Oct,48.64,13-Feb,INDIVIDUAL,0,0 years

I make minimal extra money throughout the school year as a substitute in the afterschool program.  A low-ball figure of my yearly earnings is $52,732 (or $4394/mo.)  My fiance and I both have mortgages.  His child support and new car payment (to replace a car that no longer ran), have recently increased our monthly payments to a point where we have had to rely on credit cards for necessities so that we can put all of our income towards staying current on bill payments.  Therefore, I have an uncomfortable amount of debt right now which is making it difficult for me to qualify for the loan I need to rid myself of my mortgage payment (the only reasonable offer I have received on my house, which is an offer I would like to take to vastly lower our monthly payments, would require me to pay $17,000 at closing to cover the difference to my mortgage company and closing costs.)  I have wonderful credit other than my debt-to-income ratio because I am timely with my payments, and I just need a company to take into consideration that I will be relieving myself of $158,000 worth of debt if I qualify for this personal loan to allow me to sell my house.  I realize that a personal loan of this size would typically require collateral, such as the house which I am hoping to sell, but I hope that there can be some consideration in this matter also.  I am basically caught in a catch 22 because if I don't qualify for the personal loan and have to keep my house longer, my debt will continue to accrue thus making it even less likely that I will ever qualify for the loan due to my debt-to-income ratio; meanwhile, the housing market is continuing to dwindle, making it more likely that I will not get any better offers on my house.

I am looking to get this loan to help pay down my high interest credit card. I currently go college and have used this card for my last few semesters to buy my books, computer, and school supplies. I have also used this card minimally for personal spending. I have never missed a payment on my card. The interest rate on the card is so high though and my balance is barely going down with each payment. This money would almost completely pay this card off and minimize the amount of money I have to pay each month, which would really really help me.  I am a student and work part time at a courrier service. I don't make too much money since its only part time and alot of my time is devoted to school, but like I said I've never failed to make my payment ontime and this would really save me alot of money. I will have the money every month to pay for sure. I have been working with this company for years now and it is run by a close family member so I will be sure to have my job. Plus I'd rather have honest investors at the LendingClub make my interest money than the big credit card companies.

I've always had automated payments with pretty much any company I ever dealt with.

I have since switched those over to automated, and have never had a problem since.  As you know, re-payment for this loan is automated, which guarantees you will be re-paid.

Working for the airlines schedule wise is a nightmare to accomplish ""normal"" business errands and every time they called I was flying during their normal business or bankers hours. By the time I made it to return the phone call it was either too late in the country or time zone I was located in to call or when I finally got off work last Friday night and returned there call on the last day, it was too late to call and they are not open on weekends.***   ****Now that everything has been VERIFIED for me and they have spoken to me by phone they have stated I need to relist - as my original listing expired, so I appreciate all who originally invested to please do so once again; many, many sincere thanks to all who came to assist, and anyone this time who may do so under as a new investor. I sincerely appreciate this opportunity. For those unfamiliar with my goals and mindset, please read on.****  I am dedicated to consolidating my high interest debt. Positive credit and payment history should be rewarded with reasonable terms...  I have outstanding credit and a payment history of no delinquencies or late payments in my 20 year credit history, I also tend to pay off my loans early/quickly as I enjoy a ""free-state of mind"".   I have presently saved enough money to pay off one of my credit cards (Discover), however would prefer to pay off instead the one with highest rates that is 27.99% and that is still the best (AMEX) offers for my excellent credit score and payment history.   With regards to resolving AMEX - I believe there is a better way and a lower interest rate so I can pay in a more rapid manner, and not with more going to interest than principal. The best way to achieve this is to pay it off completely by consolidating the debt into a loan with more fair interest rate terms which will allow me to pay it far more quickly.  I am asking for funds to accomplish this as both I and my wife have a clear goal in mind - purchase a home in the future and finally start a family. Due to my wife's recent pregnancy loss eariler this year, we feel that destiny rewarded our angel baby back up to heaven to give us more time to refocus and better plan ahead for our future and that of our family. As such before we try again, we want no debt and finally our very own home. As we are now very focused on paying down my debt (as we just paid off the last of hers) we feel this will finally position us to have the home and family in the near future, hopefully in a time frame of the next 2-3 years completing our dreams.

My goal is to eliminate my revolving debt so that my wife and I can then obtain a mortgage. More traditional financing options have shown no success, as we face a frustrating and ironic problem: We have too much revolving debt to obtain a loan to consolidate our revolving debt. As we are not home owners, we have no equity available to us.  We have a consistent and dependable payment history for much longer than the 2 years highlighted here. We have *NO DELINQUENCIES* during our 6 year history together. We each also have stable work histories, which is detailed below.  After looking at several other listings on this site, I wanted to preempt many questions that you may have, and have provided a summary of income and expenses. Once our revolving accounts are paid off, the majority of them will be closed. I know this may ding our credit score a bit, but we feel that we no longer need access to these lines of credit, and do not want to be tempted to put ourselves back into debt. I want each of you to be confident in your decision to fund this loan request, as it would provide my family the opportunity to take a big step towards realizing our dreams of home-ownership. I would to like to offer in advance my sincerest gratitude to each and every one of you that decides to contribute to my loan, and assure you that my family and I are a solid addition to your portfolio.

I am obtaining this loan because I have accrued some revolving debt the past several months which I will explain throughout this posting.  I would much rather pay interest to people rather than to the credit card companies so that is why I am using lending club.     I bought a brand new home some time ago and it became time to do the backyard.  The yard is huge and took a lot of time and money to complete but it is now done.  I am also getting married very soon so we not only had to pay for the backyard but we also had to pay for the remainder of our wedding.  Needless to say, our expenses have been very high these past few months but everything is now paid for and it is business as usual now and time to pay off the debt.     With this loan, I am going to pay off my revolving credit card debt and a loan I already have with Lending Club.  I obtained a loan in January of this year with Lending Club in the amount of $16,000 with a monthly payment of $530.  I have paid that loan down to a balance of $6990 in 9 months so I have averaged paying over $1,000 a month each month on that loan.  You may ask why I haven't been paying the minimum on the Lending Club loan and using the cash I would save by not paying extra on Lending Club to pay for my expenses on the backyard and wedding.  The answer is that the two main credit cards that I have been using have the introduction rate of 3% but that goes away in November so it made sense to do what I have been doing.     The lending club loan I referenced above I obtained due to a vehicle.  Unfortunately, I made a couple poor choices in college in changing vehicles and kept on rolling negative equity into cars that I purchased.  When I worked for my company prior to this, I bought a new Dodge vehicle and rolled in quite a bit of negative equity.  With my prior company, they did not provide me with a company car so I had to use my own vehicle.  I put 30,000 miles on the vehicle in one year and then I left that company to come to my current company and they provide me with a company vehicle.  I had to sell my Dodge with a ton of miles in a awful economy with a lot of negative equity in it to start with.  I had to get rid of it way below blue book and took a huge loss.  Live and learn.     I am a Marketing Representative with a Insurance Company with a base salary of $77,500.  In addition to the salary, I receive monthly commissions based on performance and year to date through Septempber I have made $79,000 so far and I project to make $107,000 for the year at least.  I have been with this company for a year and a half and have complete job security.  I have a company car so I have no car payment, no insurance, no maintenance, and no fuel expenses.  Also, I work from home so my company pays for my cell phone, home phone, and cable internet.  With all of those things, that adds up to be a lot of money that I save each month for expenses.  I also have a side job with a friend that I make $150/month in as well.     Income:   $9000/month salary   Expenses:   Lending Club:  From my calculations, it will be $640/month or so with this loan amount. Student Loan:  $150 Mortgage:  $2250 (split 2 ways with my fiancee) Utilities/Food/Entertainment:  Varies, but $500 is probably about average   As you can see, my income is great versus my expenses.  I have no late or missed payments on my credit report and never will.  My credit score is lower than usual just because I have the revolving debt on it right now and that impacts the score.  Before this debt was on the reports a few months ago, my credit scores were all around 720.    Thank you very much for reading this very long posting and considering this loan.

It is not an extravagant wedding at all, but they do cost a lot of money now a days.   I can handle the monthly payment with out any problem as my income will include the new payment into my budget and the numbers work with in my monthly budget for my current cash flow.    On a personal note I think this site and concept is very nice as it allows others to simply help others and make a profit in return as an investor. I do plan to join the investor community here in the near future.  Thank you for your time, consideration  and help in funding this request.

We're a happily married couple (17 years) with children, and we're seeking a loan to eliminate our credit card debt. For years, we've consistently paid more than minimum payments and paid on time.   Recently an incident that resulted from the Chase taking over of WaMu has made us wary of credit cards in general.  We were told that we had agreed to accepting statements via email (something we do not recall agreeing to). However, their first email statement was sent to an old email address. When we discovered the error and realized our payment was late, we immediately paid. However, Chase DOUBLED our interest rate as a result of this one late payment!    I'm sure you can understand our frustration with Chase since we were always a good, long-time customer of WaMu with no history of delinquencies.   HSBC is another company that has raised interest rates recently with no apparent reason. We were simply notified they were raising rates, and there was nothing we could do about it.   We are asking for a loan to pay off all our credit card debt and get out from under these ridiculous interest rates. We've always paid more than minimum payments, but with rates this high, it's virtually impossible to pay them off.   We run a successful marketing business with lots of high-paying jobs on the books. And since we specialize in marketing, we are experts in creating new business for ourselves ""on-demand"" (recently we ran a promotion for $300 and generated $8000 in sales in 10 days).

I'm 28, have a wife, 4 kids, and one on the way. I have a B.S. in Engineering and have been working within my degree since I graduated college in May 2005. I am successful in what I do and have been a salaried employed by the same company (minus a 5 month hiatus where I quit to work for another company) since I graduated. As a note, my company was more than willing to take me back, thank goodness.   My situation is probably not unique from many other people's however one thing that is unique about me is that I respect and fulfill every debt that I have incurred. I have never had negative comments on my credit report and do whatever it takes to fulfill my obligations including taking second jobs and working as much as 100 hours a week or more.   So you are probably wondering how I got to the point where I am writing this asking for a loan to pay off credit cards. When I married my wife she had a 2 year old son. At that point I had two years of college left. Within these two years, my stepson's father dragged us into court 4 times. Since college he has dragged us into court 2 more times. Attorney's fees stacked up fast and during college we had no other option. Either pay cash and be forced to live on credit or visa versa. Needless to say by the time I graduated and started my career we were already way behind the financial 8-ball and have not been able to recuperate.    I feel probably like most, that there is no way out and no light at the end of the tunnel. I will not try a counseling scam and until now I had no knowledge of peer-to-per lending. I think the concept is brilliant. Why not help others that are willing to help you. Its a win win situation.   I don't feel I have been irresponsible with my credit. I don't have ""toys"", expensive electronics (I salvaged our TV from my neighbors trash), or even go on vacation. Regardless, its to the point now where I need to see a light at the end of the tunnel. If I can see a date on a calendar where I know the debt will be gone that would be a great relief to me and my marriage.  When I was growing up, the one thing I swore to myself was that I was going to be financially stable for my kids. I wanted them to grow up without worrying about money as I did. Not that my kids are old enough to worry about that now but if this continues I know I will fail.

I currently run a gym that offers boxing, mixed martial arts, and personal training. Presently the gym is located in an industrial park, and is inconvenient to our 131 members, due to the lack of parking. The goal of the gym is to grow and be a more accessible location.     There is a need for more equipment to accommodate the members. The current location is approximately 3,000 square feet, while the new location is roughly 5,000 square feet. At times members are forced to exercise close together.  Extra space will allow the addition of new equipment and there will be ample room for the members to work out. With the growth of membership space in the facility is scarce.     The current location of the gym is simply a loading bay. There is no air ventilation, and the gym gets rather hot and humid.  The new location will be beneficial because it has a ventilation system that would create a better comfort level to the members of the gym. Without proper ventilation we run the risk of people having heat related illnesses.     Overall the move to this new facility I will be able to better manage the everyday operations of the gym while providing a more comfortable environment for the members to work out. The new location will also provide an enhanced location that is easier to access for members. There will be more space for new equipment, ample space for all of the activities happening daily.

With the drought in financing to acquire homes I have lately been buying mobile homes located in mobile home parks with cash and renting them out.  I buy the mobiles with my cash and rehab them. Once the home is completed and filled with a tenant or tenant/buyer I obtain a private lending loan to recover my cost and to move on to the next project.  This loan would cover my acquisition and rehab cost for the property. The tenant pays a weekly rent of $120 a week. The lot rent is $170 a month. This property cash flows approximately $350 a month averaged out over the course of a year leaving plenty of room for a loan of $5000.  My Experience:  I have acquired over 50 properties in the past 3 years and run a property management company that manages over 150 units in the Northwest Georgia area.  I have raised over $500,000 in private money for acquiring single family homes over the past 3 years and continue to do so. I can provide documentation of security deeds for mortgages from my private lenders and the cancellations showing that the loans were paid off.  I have two full time contractors that work for me and rehab the properties that we acquire and we quickly fill most all of our units.  My private money website for the single family homes is located at http://www.privatedollar.com. My management company's website is located at http://www.picksimple.com.  Please note that my credit rating may seem risky however in general my score is most affected by my debt to income. I have several mortgages on my report in addition the income on my tax returns being lower due to the number of deductions I take from my business so please keep that in mind.

This is the first step, and somewhat urgent.    [More about me, the borrower]   I work for a personal finance company. So, I am very aware of the responsibilities associated with borrowing money. I chose Lending Club because I can responsibly ""pay-as-I-go"" on this restoration project rather than take on too much additional debt at once. I maintain good credit. My lower borrowing score reflects existing mortgage and student loan debt obligations.  Thank you for your interest in my project and your contribution to this loan.

I would very much rather owe one institution/lender than several.  This way I could also save on my car insurance, by not having to have full-coverage.    Also, I do get paid cash but this has not affected my credit score since I have paid on time, not going to say always because there were two instances where I paid late, but not later than 15 days past the due date, and this was over a year.    I'm responsible and in no manner will I misuse the money.  I'm a college graduate, hence why I'm in debt, I used my credit cards for tuition, books, gas, meals, and supplies.  I don't want to damage my credit, so debt consolidation is out of the question, so is bankruptcy.  I don't believe in the easy way out, regardless the situation I made a conscious choice to use my credit cards even though it was for college.  But now, I ask to have only one payment, it would facilitate making the payments, less of a headache.  Please consider my request, I will be forever grateful.

I also wish to increase my direct marketing through brochure and other mailings and e-marketing methods. In addition, I wish to expand my memberships in area chambers of commerce, the Better Business Bureau (who have offered me membership), sustainable building organizations and market related list services. 2.	I wish to improve my skills. I need to cover the cost of purchasing Archicad ? a powerful CAD software -, the cost of instruction, the time to learn it properly, and the purchase of  a plotter (needed with cad). 3.	I wish to improve my office facility. I need a new office sign, plus new office carpeting as well as lighting and furniture.  To put this request in context ? I am a registered architect and have been working in the field for 33 years, and in private practice for 20 years. This is the first time, in all that time, that I have sought a business loan. During that time, I always had an abundance of work, all through referrals. The thrust of my work has always been what is now referred to as Green (environmentally responsible) design.

The steps I?ve outlined above are in my mind critical to staying competitive. I am confident in my professional skills and wish to significantly expand the means by which I pursue delivering greater excellence to a wider clientele.

For all of this time we have been customers of Bank of America, with an exemplary record -- never late on anything, no bounced checks, perfect A++ rating. Last December, as a ""thank you"" for our quarter century of solid business, Bank of America cut our business credit. This left us without the ""bridge"" capital that we use for seasonal fluctuations in our business income.   Our contracts are usually enacted in the 2nd and 3rd quarters of each year. Therefore, around January each year, we have used our credit means to ""bridge"" operational costs and payments, to get to the next series of contracts. And that is the reason for this request.   It was as a result of a TV news story that I have decided to try this, to see if we can make it work. Although we are a small family company, in the last two tax years our company did a solid $157,000 and $148,000 in taxable revenue, respectively. We can fax or email you the tax returns as proof. The two principals both have excellent credit rating. I can also provide you with both FICA scores.  This small amount we are seeking will help us at a time when our company needs this ""bridge"". We can either pay it off incrementally, or in full upon the occasion of our next contract. Our last contract was worth $84,000, and the one we are now in the process of securing will be at least that much. This is one of four permanent clients, plus others as we make the sale.

This loan will provide me the opportunity to further my education, consolidate some of my indebtedness and advance my career and income.   I'm extremely excited about my decision to accomplish my long awaited dream of obtaining my Masters degree in Psychology and Counseling.  Although I joyfully taught in the public school system for 23 years, my desire was always to be of greater service.  Most recently, I have practiced as a licensed Real Estate Associate Broker in Colorado.   Suddenly I have found myself divorced, financially challenged and responsible to a large degree for the care nurturing and well-being of my beloved 9 year old granddaughter.  Being of sound mind and spirit, I'm well aware that NOW is the time to take action, move forward in positive directions and create a bright future for myself and my little one.   As my teaching license expired in 2005, My immediate goal is to begin my Masters Program and reinstate my teaching license after completion of my first 6 semester hours, which will enable me to substitute teach while continuing my education.  As the opportunity arises I will also sell homes and vacant land to supplement my income while attending school.  Realizing that my requested loan amount may fall a bit short of financing my entire Masters, I am confident that I will be able to secure scholarships or grants to complete my degree program.  I hope to graduate within 18 months of enrolling.   Upon completion of my degree, my intent is to be employed as a school counselor within the public school system or practice family counseling with a private counseling service provider, thus increasing my income and ability to repay this essential loan.   In the long-term, my fondest wish is to establish a very special ranch, in my mountain home area, which will provide unique opportunities for handicapped children and adults alike, as well as services, facilities and respites for families in need.

BUSINESS BACKGROUND  The current owner works full-time as a professional in another industry and is overwhelmed by the business. She'd rather focus on her career than run a business, and is willing to accept $99K for it, but is requiring a significant portion down. We will be putting $50K down, and pay off the remainder within 6 months.   If we end up not acquiring the business because of insufficient capital, and yet this loan is approved, it will immediately be paid back.  The business is a truck (mobile clinic) with a hydrostatic body composition dunk tank. The owners of these clinics visit gyms/fitness clubs and run body fat tests all day long, parked out front. Clubs are very eager to have the clinics there. We can hype their personal training services, draw in potential members people from the area, and we can offer a small revenue share.   BUSINESS' FINANCIALS  Tests are $45, with discounts for repeat customers. Accounting for repeats, the average price per test is $35. Most clinics operate part-time for a modest 6 hours (by choice), yielding them between 20 - 30 tests/day (5 - 6 tests/hour). Trucks in less populous areas have cash flows of $20K - $25/monthly.  Note that 20 - 30/day is an average of _all territories_, such as St. Louis, Milwaukee, etc. The populations of these areas are _far_ thinner in comparison to the region we will be taking over, which is everything south of LA. Only one clinic has the rights to a greater population--Northern California-- which performs very well, with tests in the 30 - 40 tests/day range, operating less than 8 hours/day. We will be operating for more hours to support the great demand in our region: 12 - 16, instead of merely 6 or 8. The only days the clinic will not be in operation are the major holidays (e.g. Thanksgiving, Christmas).  Monthly operating costs are very low: $2,000 - $3,000, plus hourly staffing.  CASH FLOW  Based on the data from existing clinics, we've projected two estimates of cash flow. With operating expenses so low, we could do half our projections and _still_ be profitable.  Conservative:  	$35/test x 35 tests/day x 30 days = $37K/month.  Projected:  	$35/test x 45 tests/day x 30 days = $47K/month.  MY BACKGROUND/FINANCES  I've been employed at a technology company that sells data to Fortune 500 companies since graduating with a BA in Business Management of IS in 2006. My role is Lead Developer (programmer) of the software development team. Yearly income is $55K, and I have unexercised stock options whose shares constitute 1.4% of the company. 	  Money in/month:   	$4,583.33 gross  Money out/month:  	* Rent: $400 	* Student loans: $275 	* Food: $400 	* Cell and utilities: $200 	* Credit card payments: $75 	* No vehicle expenses; public transportation at $70 	* Medical: $30 	* Misc.: $250 	Total: $1,700 +/- 100  MY BUSINESS PARTNER  My partner is the owner of a Cold Stone Creamery (gourmet ice cream), which he paid for in cash. Since taking ownership of the Cold Stone, same-store sales have increased 14%--one of the highest increases of all 1,400 stores nationwide.",small_business,More capital to buy existing business,981xx,WA,6.41,0,2-Jan,2,,,9,0,1932,11.40%,14,f,0,0,1675.3,632.3,1285.72,389.58,0,0,0,9-Apr,335.76,16-May,INDIVIDUAL,0,0-10 years

Rather than just replacing the head with the stock engine internals, I plan on purchasing a fully custom built motor which will cost approximatley $5,000 to $6,500 depending on the options.  This will also help increase the value of the car and provide more longevity.  The car is so rare that since I purchased it in 2005, it's value has only depreciated $2000.  I am willing to use it as collateral if necessary.  Also, on my credit report there is one delinquent account for like $120, which I am in the process of trying to resolve right now.  It was from an AT&T wireless bill from like 2000/2001 which I settled and just popped up with a collection agency.  I called AT&T and they can't even find the account in their systems.  So now I am in the process of trying to resolve it with Pallisades collections.  I am also going to be interested in purchasing the home I currently live in from my parents within the next 2 to 3 years, and want to be able to qualify for a good rate on a loan.

The latest version of VinyasaMT was released in January of 2008 and already has a small customer base – about 50 paid subscriptions to date.    And now, as of Friday, April 4, 2008, we received a signed letter of intent from Ford Motor Company to provide VinyasaMT and the data management services behind it, to over 100 of Ford’s approved accessory suppliers. This agreement with Ford requires each supplier to purchase a minimum of one subscription of VinyasaMT. Our conservative goal is to sign up half of this supplier base by December 31, 2008. This equals $100,000 of revenue.  The money we are requesting will help support this increase in customer base. It requires the immediate hiring of one or two data management employees and the upgrading of our hardware infrastructure.   Additional information about ADR International, Inc.

I have been working on my credit score for almost six months now with Lexington Law firm and Credit Bureau Experts, yet still the score does not get better.

I am applying to the lending club because your offer for a three (3) year loan at 11.66% interest rate and 12.7% APR is almost what I was looking for.  However,  What I was looking for was $15,000 for a five (5) year loan at around $297.00 a month.  This fits into my budget.  I did not expect to have to pay $495.79 a month for a personal loan.    Although,  the loan terms is three years; it comes close to what i am looking for.  I have decided to make some adjustments to my monthly budget and since the loan term is three years; $495.79 a month did not come up to be a major problem in my monthly budget.  However,  I did have to cut back on some little things.  I would just have to be budget conscious for the next three years.    Again,  Three years is not a long time.

A women's clothing boutique is being sold close to where we live.  This is a great location as it is across the street from a middle school and sandwiched between a brand new neighborhood and a developing neighborhood.  It is being sold because the seller has 2 other businesses and is unable to grow & manage this boutique to achieve profitability quicker.  Though there will be seller financing, a down payment is expected and we will need some extra money to act as a buffer for intangibles.  The Good: We tend to quickly increase profitability by lowering some of the overhead costs.  We intend to sell retail as well as act as a broker for those looking to make high end specialty purchases.  We will develop the website so that it will serve as a social networking site that will allow us to take input from shoppers who are looking for unique fashions.  Items will be sold on the site, and overstock items will be directed to overseas markets.  We intend to keep inventories fairly low.  My income is sufficient to cover extra problems that may arise.  My wife is not working and will manage & grow the business full time.  The Bad: This is retail and it may not be profitable for at least 6 months (thats not your problem though....).  The customer base is undeveloped and we will need to do a significant amount of marketing to build it.  This should not be too big a problem though as my wife is a recent MBA grad.  The Ugly: I'm in grad school and my loans will come calling by the end of summer in 08.  Since my last personal loan I have not defaulted or been late with any payments, but I have gotten more credit cards and have increased my available balances on all of them very recently; this may be a why it has gone down.  Also, I've gone from W2 employee to 1099 contractor (no taxes hoooray!), the uncertainty of self employment may have altered the grade as well.   About Me: I am a DBA working in the Atlanta Metro area.  I am also an investor in a few other things as well such as ATMs and P2P lending.

I'm a recently engaged, hardworking professional in my mid-20's who is trying to start a new life with my partner, but several roadblocks have come up along the way.  I have always been a very honest, do-it-myself kind of person. Growing up in a lower middle class family, I worked and supported myself all throughout high school and college.   I currently work as a program director at a nonprofit organization that provides clinical, legal, and shelter services to domestic violence victims. It is a salaried position with full benefits (but the salary is at a typical nonprofit level). My partner is an artist/illustrator. We both work very hard and do not have a lavish lifestyle at all. We've tried to be frugal and save, but my partner recently had some legal, automobile, and medical costs to pay for which wiped out our savings.  My partner has sold the car, I have taken on a freelance job in addition to my full-time job, and now we are looking to move to a cheaper apartment as well as eventually get married. A loan of $10,000 would allow us to pay the last month's rent on the current apartment, pay for the security/first/last on a new, more affordable apartment, pay for moving expenses (we do not have much furniture or possessions), pay off my partner's legal and medical expenses, and maybe set aside some for our new life together.  I'm not proud to be requesting money from strangers because I've always tried to work my way through life and figure things out, but the situation has just become so tough and desperate with the fact I need to support my partner, and I would do anything for us to have a life together. Moving to a cheaper apartment and paying off the unexpected legal, automobile, and medical expenses will allow us to better manage our income and get back on our feet, and our top priority would be paying back this loan.  Also, I'm not quite sure how this process works as I've never done it before, but we currently live in New York but I was originally based in New Jersey, so that is why my location indicates New Jersey (we may also end up moving to New Jersey due to the more affordable rent).

I also run my own web design business, which has become more successful and I am looking to expand -- purchase more equipment, and hire one web developer to work with me.  I decided to get a loan for two reasons:   1) to provide a safety net for me to expand my business. I am currently getting larger projects than I have in the past, and I will need to get another person to help me finish them. Once these projects are done, this investment should pay for itself.  2) I want to establish a lending history with installment loans so that in the future, banks will be able to lend me greater amounts than I am asking for now.  Over the past five years, I have always paid my credit cards on time and that earned me ... well, a score of 729 on Experian, (766 and 768 on TransUnion and Equifax), so I guess you can see I'm a pretty low risk.
